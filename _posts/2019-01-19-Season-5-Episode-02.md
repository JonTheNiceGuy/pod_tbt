00:24 Wayne welcomes us to Series 5 Episode 2 from a cloudy cold Bristol while Mark hails us from a cold and foggy Kilkishen. The guys welcome the bug killing cold winter weather, though bug killing is probably the pervue of the [bug report podcast](https://bugreport.co.uk/)

01:46 Mark tells us about some listener feedback and his response to it. Mark tried various distributions on a [Dell Dimension 3000](https://downloads.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_desktop/esuprt_dimension_desktops/dimension-3000_owner%27s%20manual_en-us.pdf) (see the appendix for specs) with a CDROM drive, 256MB RAM and a 20GB hard drive (that had Mandriva 2008 on it before it was wiped) before settling on [VectorLinux 7.1](http://vectorlinux.com/) as the best user experience with that kind of hardware. The guys discuss the value of using a machine like that for browsing the web and just how much value you can get out of older hardware.

17:29 Wayne tells us about [Solo Keys](https://solokeys.com/), a recently [crowd funded](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/conorpatrick/solo-the-first-open-source-fido2-security-key-usb) open source [FIDO2](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/) security key.

24:07 Wayne moves the conversation on to [self hosting](https://selfhostedweb.org/), or hosting your own web services from home. Wayne recommends you have to start somewhere, and in his opinion [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org/#/whatsyunohost) makes self hosting accessible to everyone. [Piwigo](https://www.piwigo.org/) is a recommended photo sharing application.

32:00 Wayne thanks our listeners for their recent feedback, the [Admin Admin podcast](https://www.adminadminpodcast.co.uk/) for joining our Telegram group and all our [patreons and recent donations](https://thebinarytimes.net/contact.php#patrons).

32:35 Mark tells us he's subscribed to and recommends [Wireframe](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/), a magazine "Lifting the lid on video games". He also tells us that he received [the MagPi Magazine](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/) and [HackSpace](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/) as Christmas presents from [Raspberry Pi Press](https://store.rpipress.cc/) and was so impressed with [Hackspace](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/) that he may well subscribe to that also. Mark goes on to discuss the [Looking back](https://magazines-static.raspberrypi.org/issues/full_pdfs/000/000/029/original/Wireframe05.pdf?1547224550) article (page 14) and the news that [Jay Pinkerton](https://www.pcgamer.com/portal-2-co-writer-jay-pinkerton-seems-to-be-back-at-valve/) and [Erik Wolpaw](https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/4/18168383/valve-erik-wolpaw-portal-half-life) are working with [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) which must mean [Half Life 3 confirmed](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/half-life-3-confirmed)... Mark also tells us about [Gaming as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_as_a_service) and [Improbable's](https://improbable.io/) improbable [Spatial OS](https://improbable.io/games) with it's thousand player online matches.

37:20 Wayne tells us about [OMG! Ubuntu!'s](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk) news that [Supertuxkart's online Multilplayer is Ready for Testing!](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/01/supertuxkart-online-beta-testing).

38:14 Mark follows this up with news of a failed open source project from [Squid's](https://steamcommunity.com/id/OSCowner) [Open Source Community](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/opencommunity#) on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/) that [Findx has closed its doors](https://privacore.github.io/).

39:12 Wayne tells us he's picked up [Karl Pilkington's An Idiot Abroad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1702042/) while charity shopping and used a [Linux Tech Show's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8GyxjVRPZw) on [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) to properly choose the right settings to rip DVDs. 

41:35 Under the Hood! Mark's Under the Hood is to chat about [AT&T's 10 predictions for the next 25 years](https://www.cablinginstall.com/articles/2019/01/att-predictions-next-25-years.html). Waynes under the hood is [12 Best VLC Tricks you Might Not Know About!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltd98ahfItE) followed on by [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu), a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. To install just type `sudo apt install ncdu` with example usage being: `sudo du -ah --max-depth=1  / | sort -hr`

49:26 Irish saying of the podcast - "D&uacute;n an Doras!" or Close the Door
