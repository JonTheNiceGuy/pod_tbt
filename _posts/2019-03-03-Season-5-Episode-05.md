He did consult the [Raspberry Pi Power Consumption Data web-page](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2018/11/raspberry-pi-power-consumption-data/) to help him figure stuff out, and he used [these](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-motioneyeos-on-raspberry-pi-surveillance-camera-system/) [tutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/cctv-raspberry-pi-based-system-storage-motioneyeos/) to install [MotionEyeOS](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos).
