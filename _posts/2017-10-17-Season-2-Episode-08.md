00:24 Wayne introduces Series 2 Episode 8 of the most Action Packed Binary Times so far from a murky Bristol while Mark regails us with tales of hurricanes and bad weather that has been and on the way. Fairly Action Packed so far!

02:46 Mark tells us he's been doing bits and pieces with [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) and is quite excited about a discovery of his from yesterday, called [KolibriOS](http://kolibrios.org/en/), an OS written entirely in Assembler/FASM which he intends to install on an old pentium 3 machine he has lying around to play some old strategy games on. Minimum specs are just 8MB RAM and a couple MBs storage. Wow!

06:20 Wayne and Mark mention the interview they conducted with [Alex / Squid](https://steamcommunity.com/id/OSCowner) that is to follow later in the show. Alex runs a community group on steam called [Open-Source Community](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/opencommunity) in which he promotes open source technologies and the guys talk to him about his method of doing so on a proprietary platform among other things.

07:00 Wayne tells us some more things about [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) and gives us all a tip to get rid of the broken battery message which is to run [dconf-editor](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/dconf) using [synapse](https://launchpad.net/synapse-project), go to `org->mate->power-manager`, uncheck `notify-low-capacity`. Annoying message gone and forgotten about, hurray!

09:19 Wayne describes how he installed Ubuntu MATE with [Remmina](http://www.remmina.org/wp/),  [realmd](https://freedesktop.org/software/realmd/), [krb5-user](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/kerberos.html) and [kerberos](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/), [software-properties-common](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=software-properties-common), [python-software-properties](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&keywords=python-software-properties&searchon=names) and [packagekit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/PackageKit/). His main concerns were his email, access to networked storage drives and printing. He's pleased to say the whole thing has been quite successful and not a terrible idea at all.

16:18 Wayne has purchased some maker books from a previous [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) and has this tip for us from the [Linux for Makers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031338.do) book, which is this: when using `sudo apt upgrade` you don't need to type `y` or `Y`, just hit the enter key and you're done. It's the small things that make the difference!

18:47 After Mark warns of potential dog barking, he tells us that the [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) phone from [Purism](https://puri.sm) has been crowdfunded! This is great news for anyone who cares about their privacy while using a mobile device.

22:08 Wayne apologises for some down time on [the binarytimes website](https://thebinarytimes.net). Mark suggests if more people would support on us on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thebinarytimes) then we could afford a high tech company to give us 99.99% uptime instead of self hosting.

23:39 Wayne introduces our interview with [Alex / Squid](https://steamcommunity.com/id/OSCowner) in which we discuss all things open source. Alex mentions a number of cool opensource projects, including [Zorin OS](https://zorinos.com/) (you can find how Zorin OS is being used by the Italian city of Vicenza [here]( https://itsfoss.com/vicenza-windows-zorin/)), [Reactos](https://www.reactos.org/), an open source replacement for Windows and [findx](https://www.findx.com/), an open source search engine that respects your privacy. Alex also mentions that another way to follow his open source travails besides his Steam [Open-Source Community](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/opencommunity) work is to check out his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyOcKBNGddA6qysIG9ME7-A). We hope you enjoy!

41:44 Under the Hood! Mark kicks it off with a discussion around [moreutils](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/), a "collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to write long ago when unix was young." Quite a few interesting tools that are worth checking out.

45:06 Wayne asks Mark about iotop as a lead into his own Under the Hood, which is an epic Under the Hood, and that is `sudo iftop`, to monitor network traffic. How epic is that! [note: A really good article on iftop can be found in the [Linux Journal](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/sysadmins-toolbox-iftop)

49:49 Irish saying of the podcast is Beidh muid ar ais - We will be back!
