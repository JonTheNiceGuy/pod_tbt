00:26 Wayne welcomes us to the first episode of Season 5 from a cold but calm Bristol. Mark tells us it's a great day in Kilkishen with blue skies and faraway clouds. They both marvel at the idea of a new year and a new season! The guys relate their Christmas experiences for the listeners.

03:54 Mark tells Wayne about his stand out Christmas present being [Spuddy's Juggling Balls](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Juggling-Spuddy-Balls/dp/B01N0LZEJ1). Wayne's stand out gift was a [Star Trek Tricorder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Star-Starfleet-Medical-Tricorder-Collectors/dp/B000E6A0GE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1546696942&sr=8-1&keywords=star+trek+medical+tricorder). The guys then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org/). Wayne tells us about his use of the [TV Hat](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-tv-hat/) with the [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) as a recorder and recommends any one else interested to try it out. This leads to a discussion around the versatility of free and open source hardware and software vis a vis proprietary services and hardware manufacturers.

16:08 Mark tells us about Necunos releasing the [Necunos NC_1](https://necunos.com/index.html?link=t1) as a developer and early adopter device. While he comments on the price of the device he thinks it's great to have a free device out there.

21:32 Mark goes on to tell us that he's been doing a small bit of reading and made his Christmas and New Year's Card using [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Libre Office Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/draw/). He's also been doing a bit with [Open Suse Leap 15](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.0), and tells us he also built a retro arcade machine using a [case](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-gaming/products/retroflag-superpi-case-deluxe-edition-j) and a [Raspberry Pi 3b](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus) as a Christmas present.

23:35 Wayne tells us he's been doing a lot and nothing at the same time. Some critical thinking around password management has seen Wayne adopting [KeepassXC](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc) while considering the advantages of using a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/). He's also using [andotp](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.shadowice.flocke.andotp/) for two factor authentication. Mark tells us about Purism's [Librem Key](https://puri.sm/products/librem-key/) and how he hopes Purism's building up a nice little hardware ecosystem for itself. Wayne also advises that you should always have two authentication keys. Mark advises he may need twenty. The guys round out the segment with a discussion around [security vs convenience](https://auth0.com/blog/security-vs-convenience/).

41:15 The guys talk about [DNS over HTTPS on a pi-hole](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns-over-https/).

45:18 Under the Hood - Mark mentions the [Chaos Computing Club's](https://www.ccc.de/en/) [Lightning Talks](https://c3lt.de/35c3/schedule/) have some great hints and tips and under the hoods. He goes on to mention the [STEM Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/stem-books) that is available for another short while that's got some great material. The guys discuss some python learning material, like [Head First Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920003434.do), Mike Saunder's [Hayne's Coding Manual](https://haynes.com/en-gb/coding-manual) and the latest [Python 2019](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/python-packt-2019-books) by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/) from [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com).

50:20 Wayne tells us about [setting static IP addresses in Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1200132).

55:25 Irish saying of the podcast - "Is binn b&eacuteal ina thost" - Silence is golden, except as Mark points out when you're making a podcast then not so much!

Thanks for listening, we hope you enjoyed it as much as we did making it!
