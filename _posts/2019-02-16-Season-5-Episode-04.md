00:24 Wayne welcomes us to Season 5 Episode 4 from a slightly overcast but nice weather Bristol. Mark tells us Spring is in the air and goes on to demonstrate his complete lack of gardening know how, luckily this is almost a Linux podcast and not a garden know how podcast!

03:10 Mark tells us about the upcoming [Global Diversity CFP day](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/), something that [Jon Spriggs](https://jon.sprig.gs/blog/) of the [AdminAdmin podcast](https://www.adminadminpodcast.co.uk/) brought to our attention. Mark also tells us about the [Prime Numbers](https://librivox.org/prime-numbers/) audio book from [LibreVox](https://librivox.org/). Unfortunately Mark won't be able to make it to [Global Diversity CFP Day in Dublin](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/events/67) as he's going to [GamerFest](http://gamerfest.ie/) in Limerick on the same weekend, where he's hoping to meet [John Romero](https://www.romerogames.ie/team/).

07:43 Mark goes on to tell us about the release of [MikeOS 4.6](http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/) that can be downloaded using this [link](http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/mikeos-4.6.zip). The guys discuss the direction of the podcast towards 8 (or maybe even 4) bit OSes.

09:31 The guys go on to discuss LibreOffice's announcement of [LibreOffice 6.2](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2019/02/07/libreoffice-6-2/) and that it is already available as a [snap](https://snapcraft.io/libreoffice).

15:20 Wayne tells us he's been watching a lot of the [Fosdem 2019 talks](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/events/) and recommends them to everyone.

16:34 Mark goes on to tell us about the [Snapcraft Live sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZySQgBxmM) on Youtube.

17:37 Wayne tells us he's been watching [Decentralizing the Web Despite Itself](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fosdem/2019/UD2.208/decentralizing_the_web_despite_itself.webm), a disheartening talk by [Karen Sandler](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/speaker/karen_sandler/) and [Bradley Kuhn](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/speaker/bradley_m_kuhn/) about [Full Software Freedom](https://video.fosdem.org/2019/Janson/full_software_freedom.mp4) and this leads to a discussion about how we live in these modern times. Wayne has a couple of good tips for youtube replacements, being [hooktube](https://hooktube.com/) and [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/).

26:25 Wayne tells us the story of the problems he's been having with his desktop machine, and the utility of transparent terminals. In Ubuntu MATE, you can achieve this as follows: In the mate-terminal, go to 'Edit' -> 'Profiles'.  Select Default and click 'Edit'. Click on the 'Background' Tab and select 'Transparent background'. Wayne's transparency is set to approx 75%.

31:59 Wayne tells us about his record breaking tab addiction, some useful features in Firefox, and the guys discuss changing software options.

36:23 Wayne tells us about [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/home/) and how he's using it to talk on the [bugcast](https://thebugcast.org/) podcast's IRC. He also mentions some further Fosdem viewing, namely [Matrix in the French State](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix_french_state/) and [Breaking the 100 bps barrier with Matrix](https://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/matrix.webm).

42:00 Under the Hood: Mark's under the hood is [dlocate](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/dlocate.1.html).

44:08 Wayne discusses how he's been investigating using thin clients and servers at work. He also talks about the [host](https://linux.die.net/man/1/host) command.

49:04 Irish saying of the podcast - "T&aacute; s&eacute; go h&aacute;lainn!", or it is beautiful!

We hope you enjoy it as much as we did making it!
