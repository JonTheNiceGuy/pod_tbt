00:27 intro

01:20 Mark got a haircut, and Wayne did too!

01:46 Mark tells us that he's been listening to [badvoltage.org](http://www.badvoltage.org/), [Homeland](http://craphound.com/category/homeland/) and [Jerusalem](https://www.recordedbooks.com/title-details/9781501931697)

03:31 Finally, some Linux chat! Wayne talks about [SSH](https://www.openssh.com/manual.html)

06:33 Wayne starts to talk about his adventures in [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)

08:20 Mark mentions [Openhab](http://www.openhab.org/) in conjunction with Raspeberry Pi projects

09:31 Mark tells us he's heard [Openhab arrives as a snap](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/02/09/openhab-arrives-as-a-snap/)

10:16 Wayne discusses Martin Wimpress' excellent [guide](https://flexion.org/posts/2016-12-raspberry-pi-3-powered-nextcloud-box-on-ubuntu-core/) on setting up Nextcloud 11 on Ubuntu Core on a Raspberry Pi 3

11:29 Wayne returns the discussion to Raspberry Pi and the [sense-hat](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/)

14:21 Wayne's head melts while learning [Python](https://www.python.org/)

15:13 In Breaking News For Us, [the Raspberry Pi 3 is on sale!](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-on-sale/)

16:35 Mark installs [KDENeon](https://neon.kde.org/) on a raspberry pi? No! On a Dell Latitude D830 and a spare hdd

20:30 Wayne has a tip for [Ubuntu Mate](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) users, ctrl-space to invoke search

21:52 In More Breaking News For Us, Ubuntu Unity has a [low graphics mode!](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/01/get-easier-enable-low-graphics-mode-ubuntu)

22:51 Mark sneakily moves the conversation onto the Under the Hood tips section with [`dcfldd`](http://dcfldd.sourceforge.net/), an enhanced version of dd

25:15 Waynes under the hood tip is "`sudo !!`" for when you've forgotten sudo at the start of a command you want to run

28:24 Mark talks about [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) as a wordstar clone when in fact it's a clone of [pico!](http://www.guckes.net/pico/)

29:25 Wayne talks about [vim](http://www.vim.org/), a modal text editor

31:58 Mark mentions [xkcd's take on linux text editors.](https://xkcd.com/378/)

32:39 Wayne helpfully mentions vim-tutor . If not installed you can install it using "sudo apt install vim-runtime"

35:08 Wayne challenges Mark to go through the first two lessons of vim-tutor and Mark agrees

Wayne explains that the j,k,l and ; keys are used for navigation in vim, when in fact h, j, k and l are used for navigation (as can be seen in this [click here](http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif))

37:18 Wayne reveals that [Vim is available for Windows](http://www.vim.org/download.php/#pc)

37:42 Mark talks about [privacy badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) and [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), privacy add on for web browsers from the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/). This provoked a wide ranging discussion around privacy and shopping

46:30 Irish Saying for the show is.... [Ceart go leor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13gInoyfzI), fair enough!
