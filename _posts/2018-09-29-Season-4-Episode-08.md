00:24 Wayne Welcomes us to Season 4 Episode 8 from a sunny Bristol. Mark tells us that the fog is lifting and the skies are blue and all is calm in Kilkishen. Another Amazing Day for podcasting. The weather gets the guys talking about what activities are good to do in certain weather and how all this is related to Linux.

04:08 Wayne asks Mark what he's been up to for the last two weeks. Mark tells us he's been busy, and then goes on to talk about the [International Day against DRM](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dayagainstdrm/2018) and [what happened around the world for IDAD](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/whats_happening_international_day_against_drm). The guys have a discussion around [DRM](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management) which also takes in IoT devices, what people take stands on and the use and acceptance of proprietary software.

17:27 Mark brings the topic of conversation around to the [LibreOffice Conference 2018](https://conference.libreoffice.org/) held in [Tirana, Albania](http://www.tirana.gov.al/), from September the 25th - 28th. Mark talks about the programme and in particular the advantages Open Document Formats, [Open Source and Open Standards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuCS7QU_Rgk).

20:29 Mark asks Wayne what he's been up to, and it turns out that he's been working on audio on Linux. Wayne tells us that he uses [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/about/) [16.04](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-mate/releases/16.04.5/release/ubuntu-mate-16.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso) with the [KXStudio](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/) [plugins](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Plugins), in particular [Cadence](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Cadence) and [Carla](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Carla) and goes on to tell us about the advantages of using these. Wayne goes on to tell us that he did come across the [Sonoj Festival in Cologne](https://sonoj.org/) in his search for documentation and they have created some great [video tutorials](https://media.ccc.de/c/sonoj2017) (on audio!)

29:47 Mark asks Wayne if he has come across any good documentation for networking and systemd and goes on to ask the listeners if they have any advice on good documentation. He also asks the audience if they have any ideas on replacing feedburner.

33:33 Under the Hood: Wayne starts off with a tip on [Thunderbird email client](https://www.thunderbird.net) and that is to [compact your folders](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders) on a regular basis.
Mark follows on from this to chat about what the [Mozilla foundation is doing under the hood](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/). Mark also asks if any of the audience has any links they could point him at in order to better help him know what is going on in terms of open IoT and SCADA. The lads discuss IoT. Wayne is ok with sitting in the dark if it means not using a cloud app, Mark gets all huggy and wants to embrace IoT. They finish off the conversation with more chat about how wonderful [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is.

48:03 Irish saying of the podcast "Gheobhaidh m&eacute; bosca nua s&oacute;pa" or I will get a new box of soap. 

The guys thank their listeners, and we hope you enjoy it as much as they do making it.
