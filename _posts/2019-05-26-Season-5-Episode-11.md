00:24 Wayne welcomes us to Episode 11 with a very accurate weather report, Mark's not so much. Mark has trouble remembering the command he should type for the weather report is `curl wttr.in/[location]` and NOT wittr! The guys go on to discuss some important admin, advise everyone to resubscribe to the rss feed (well worth it since the rss feed has been upgraded), chat about how the podcast came about, and talk about how the website is a perfect reflection of the podcast's goal. Mark thanks Wayne for all his hard work on the admin side of the podcast.

09:20 Mark tells us about what he's been at for the past two weeks. He's been busy! He also tells us about a free [Linux Foundation course](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/) providing a [beginners guide to Open Source Software Development](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/beginner-guide-to-oss-development-lfc102/), which he feels may be of use to people. He also suggests people should read [Mozilla's reading list](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/reading-list-understanding-online-misinformation-problem/) to help understand the online misinformation problem. He goes on to tell us that [Plasma 5.16 Beta is now available for testing](https://kubuntu.org/news/plasma-5-15-90-plasma-5-16-beta-available-for-testing/) on [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org). He goes on to tell us that he met Iarla of the [Amiga Ireland Podcast](http://amigausers.ie/listen/) who generously gave him a [BQ Aquarius E4.5 Ubuntu Edition phone](https://www.bq.com/en/support/aquaris-e4-5-ubuntu-edition/support-sheet), as he no longer used it himself and wanted to see it put to good use, which Mark promptly sent to Wayne.

15:12 Wayne tells us about his experience with his "new" E4.5 and [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/), warts and all. He starts by describing the [interface](https://ubuntu-touch.io/features/elegance), and goes on to talk about every day use. Applications he mentions are the [Open Store](https://open-store.io/), [Telegram](https://open-store.io/app/com.ubuntu.telegram), [Signal](https://open-store.io/app/textsecure.nanuc), [Nextcloud](https://open-store.io/app/nextcloud.mateosalta), [Ghostcloud](https://open-store.io/app/me.fredl.ghostcloud), [Pdfjsviewer](https://open-store.io/app/com.ubuntu.developer.bobo1993324.pdfjsviewer), [how to get shell access](https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/userguide/advanceduse/adb.html) to your Ubuntu Touch phone, and using the [Ubports dav script for nextcloud support](https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/userguide/advanceduse/dav.html). Other apps he's installed are [Tagger](https://open-store.io/app/com.ubuntu.developer.mzanetti.tagger), and [Podbird](https://open-store.io/app/com.mikeasoft.podbird). He also notes pictures and videos work fine, [ssh](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/) and [Office 365](https://www.office.com/) work too. [Dekko 2](https://open-store.io/app/dekko2.dekkoproject) suits Wayne's needs for email. Overall, he likes the phone, it'll be his daily driver for now while he decides if it can be his permanent daily driver. One app he does need would be an [otp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password) app, which he hasn't been able to find yet for Ubuntu Touch. Wayne will report further on how he gets on with it.

49:06 Wayne tells us about the perils of using online photo books, with some Windows admin thrown in.

56:53 Under the Hood - Mark tell us about a [Digital Ocean article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units) describing how to use systemctl to manage systemd services and units.

Wayne's tip is to use the shift key in conjunction with the prtsc key to choose an area of the screen to capture. This works in [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) and should work in most other desktops.

Wayne also points us towards a [Youtube video on Linux filesystem structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw).

1:01:10 Irish saying of the podcast is "N&iacute;l s&eacute; ach a deich a chlog", or it's only 10 o'clock.
