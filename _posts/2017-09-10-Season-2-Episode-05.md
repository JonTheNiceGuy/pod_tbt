00:25 Wayne almost forgets his intro through giddiness! Probably due to the fact that the sun is mostly shining in both locations...

01:30 Mark tells us he's [back at work](https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/welcome-back-512.jpg) after his long break. He also upgraded his desktop to [17.10 beta](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/). It was such an easy experience he congratulates the [Ubuntu people](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/12/14/ubuntu-is-about-people/) on the great work that they do. He thinks he may be missing the old days of upgrading when it was such a different process, Wayne suggests [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/).Too much compiling for Mark, and others, as Mark reminises.

06:25 Mark tells us about the latest [Ubuntu Hour](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hour) in Ennis. The guys there agreed to look into projects, Mark tells us that they could look into packaging [Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org/) and also looking at community groups and helping them towards using [FOSS](http://www.freeopensourcesoftware.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) as the source of their software.

09:36 Wayne goes on to tell us that he's implemented a FOSS kiosk solution for his workplace. After some fruitless searching, he found [Porteus Kiosk](http://porteus-kiosk.org/), which perfectly fits his needs. [Porteus Kiosk Support](http://porteus-kiosk.org/support.html) gets a thumbs up for their quick response to questions. Wayne also looked into [Firefox with mkiosk](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-gb/firefox/addon/mkiosk/).

17:35 Wayne tells us about his further adventures in [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) with a [4" screen](http://www.waveshare.com/wiki/4inch_RPi_LCD_(A)). A brief discussion around [Pixel](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-pixel/) ensues after which Wayne feels the need to reiterate that he's a [Linux enthusiast](https://img0.etsystatic.com/053/0/9934273/il_340x270.726031344_fcgj.jpg) rather than a [professional](https://www.lpi.org/)! Mark is full of [enthusiasm](https://www.jamendo.com/track/616147/enthusiasm)(best to click on this link when not listening to the podcast)!

21:59 Mark tells us that [Raspberry Pi starter kits](http://ie.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/8968119/) are available on [RS Online](http://ie.rs-online.com/web/) for €125, the [Raspberry Pi 3](http://ie.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/8968660/) itself is available for €31.

23:26 The conversation turns towards [ssh](https://www.openssh.com/) and the [eternal struggle between security and usability](https://www.icyber-security.com/2017/07/15/dilemma-cyber-security-vs-convenience-vs-usability-i-just-cant-uninstall-whatsapp-here-is-why/) in general. Take from it what you will listeners!

25:57 Mark mentions [FrankenWM](https://github.com/sulami/frankenwm), a dynamic tiling window manager. Mark isn't sure how active the project is though.

27:33 Wayne brings the conversation back to security, this time physical security and the benefits of [physically controlling access to critical IT infrastructure](http://dilbert.com/strip/2008-12-07) (especially the power!). It's good to know the limits of power cycling equipment.

34:36 Mark tells us about the new mozilla podcast, [IRL](https://irlpodcast.org/). It's pretty amazing and worth checking out, according to Mark. He also mentions Mozilla's [web-literacy program](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy) and thinks it's a prerequisite to using the web.

36:57 Time for Under the Hood! Wayne has a quick look through his show notes and has these little gems:
* Byobu tip: `ctrl + F9` allows you to send the same input to every window, how cool is that!
* [Hollywood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVMn3xk5mcY) is great!
* `byobu - enable` starts byobu everytime.

41:12 Mark's under the hood is `sudo do-release-upgrade -d`. Use with caution, especially when upgrading to pre-release software!

Mark also tells us about [hwinfo](https://github.com/openSUSE/hwinfo) He tells us that hwinfo with switches or grep is really handy. options include:
* `hwinfo --disk`
* `hwinfo --short`
* `hwinfo --cpu`
* `man hwinfo` is your friend

Mark isn't sure whether [hwinfo](https://packages.ubuntu.com/artful/hwinfo) is installed by default, it seems not as it is not in the current [manifest file](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/artful-desktop-amd64.manifest) and is in the [universe repository](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu).

45:50 Irish saying for the podcast - T&aacute; m&eacute; ag [cr&iacute;ochnaithe](http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/finished) (I am finished)! The Irish is flowing!!!
