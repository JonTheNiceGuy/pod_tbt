00:24 Wayne welcomes us to the second episode of Season Three! It's dark coz the guys are recording early so there's not much of a weather report I'm afraid. Dark is about as good as it gets!

01:11 Despite Mark being busy with work he's responded to Kubuntu's [call for testing](https://kubuntu.org/news/plasma-5-12-lts-beta-available-ppa-for-testing-on-artful-bionic/) by installing [Plasma 5.12 LTS beta](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.11.95.php) on his [Kubuntu Bionic Beaver LTS Beta](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/) [test machine](https://support.lenovo.com/ie/en/solutions/pd006109). All good so far, not a single bug to report, all looking really good for a solid release! Mark also tells us that he's been playing with [chakra linux](https://www.chakralinux.org/), [Ubuntu 14.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) and [Ubuntu MATE 16.04](https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/) (to test the redmond panel) on virtual machines using [virtual machine manager](https://virt-manager.org/).

04:14 Wayne tells us that he's installed [Ubuntu MATE 17.10](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-mate/releases/17.10.1/release/ubuntu-mate-17.10.1-desktop-amd64.iso) on one of the work machines in the second site. He was prompted to do this through frustrations with Windows. Mark prompts Wayne to swap out his Windows servers with Linux.

10:00 Wayne tells us how he solved a network problem by disconnecting a rogue access point.

14:04 Wayne tells us how he changed the greeter screen on Ubuntu MATE 17.10 using [these instructions](https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/customize-slick-greeter-in-17-10/15171/4).

16:35 The guys have a conversation around using free and open source software and the sacrifices that might entail and using proprietary software and the sacrifices that might entail.

22:30 Wayne tells us that he has purchased Mike Saunder's [Haynes Coding Manual](https://haynes.com/en-gb/coding-manual). He's quite enjoying it so far and recommends anyone interested in learning Python to give it a go.

25:36 Wayne talks about options for using DNS. Wayne recommends [DNS-Watch](https://www.dnswatch.info/) while Mark mentions [unblock-us](http://un-block.us/) and [streamjack](http://streamjack.tv/). Mark asks Wayne about any hints and tips he might have for using [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) and bemoans the results he's getting with it.

35:50 Mark tells us that the [Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter is looking for contributors](https://community.ubuntu.com/t/call-for-contributors-to-the-ubuntu-weekly-newsletter/1539).

37:47 Under the Hood: Wayne has purchased yet another Raspberry Pi zero. He updates the firmware on his Raspberry pis using the following command: `sudo rpi-update`

If it comes up with command not found, run `sudo apt install rpi-update`, then run `sudo rpi-update`

Mark mentions that [hackspace ](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/) is now available from the Raspberry Pi foundation

Marks Under the Hood is a quick one to find out what kind display server you're using. Do the following:

1. Type `loginctl`. This will tell you your session number.
2. Then type `loginctl show -session` [insert session number] ` -p -Type`. This will tell you whether you are using Wayland or X.
