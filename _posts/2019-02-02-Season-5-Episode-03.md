He's introduced [Edublocks](https://edublocks.org/) to the Coding Club, which makes the transistion from [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) to [Python](https://www.python.org/) easier. This leads the discussion around to learning different languages and how [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a great language to learn. It helped Wayne make the [Rod of Doom!](https://nc.fortlands.net:444/index.php/s/RiagCM5mXWE9Con)
