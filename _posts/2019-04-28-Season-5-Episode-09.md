00:24 Wayne introduces us to Series 5 Episode 9 of the Binary Times from a wet and windy Bristol. Mark tells us it's brightening up a bit in Kilkishen after they were battered by [storm Hannah](https://merrionstreet.ie/MerrionStreet/en/News-Room/News/NDFEM_Statement_on_Preparations_for_Storm_Hannah.html).</p>

01:55 Wayne introduces us to Sebastian, a keen Linux advocate. Sebastian has joined us to tell us about a [Linux Presentation Day](http://linux-presentation-day.org.uk/) event happening in [Bristol](http://facebook.com/LPDBristolUK) on Sunday the 19th May from 2-7pm in the [Prince Street Social](http://princestreetsocial.com/). This event will demonstrate GNU/Linux Distributions running on laptops, phones and various other hardware devices. It sounds really interesting, if you're anywhere near Bristol on the 19th May then check it out! The guys also discuss the state of phones, [UBports](https://ubports.com/) and the [GPD pocket](https://www.gpd.hk/gpdpocket/).

40:26 Under the Hood - Sebastian tells us about an under the hood he came across due to a flaky HP laptop motherboard, and that is use [acpi_osi=...](https://askubuntu.com/questions/28848/what-does-the-kernel-boot-parameter-set-acpi-osi-linux-do) as a kernel boot parameter.

Mark tells us to check out the [2019 Internet Health Report](https://internethealthreport.org/2019/) and [Exxon's role in climate change denial](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming) as described by [inside climate news](https://insideclimatenews.org).

Wayne's Under the Hood is the latest [Electronics +3D printing bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/electronics-3d-printing-make-books). Sebastian suggests [Storybundle.com](https://storybundle.com) as an alternative to [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com). Wayne also talks about WPA Supplicant and suggests the priority option to force wifi to register on your preferred network. See the following for more detail:

`sudo vi /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`
```
    network {
        ssid="my-ssid"
        psk="my-network-password"
        priority=8          - [ This is a high priority, it'll join this network first if available ]
    }
```

50:45 Irish saying of the podcast: "T&aacute; s&eacute; an fhliuch", or it is very wet. After some debate about how wet it actually is, the guys settle on T&aacute; s&eacute; an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n, or it is very stormy.

Thanks for listening, we hope you enjoyed the show as much as we did making it.
