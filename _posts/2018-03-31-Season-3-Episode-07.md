00:24 Wayne kicks off episode 7 of season 3 with our usual weather report, followed by Mark and then followed by our special guest today, [Mike Saunders](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/author/mikesaunders/)! Gloomy Grey pervades the weather in Bristol and Germany, while it's a nice crisp clear morning in Clare!

01:55 Mike tells us a bit about himself, including [Mike OS](http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/), the [Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org/) and Social Media. This leads to a discussion around the [pros and cons of Social Media](https://netivist.org/debate/social-networking-pros-and-cons) and privacy issues.

08:31 Wayne congratulates Mike on creating [Mike OS](http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/). Mike thinks it's fairly easy to make an OS! :)

10:23 Mike tells us about his daily drivers, A [Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) with [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) on it and a [libreboot Lenovo Thinkpad 220](https://libreboot.org/docs/hardware/x200.html) running [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) as well. Wayne tells us he's on [Ubuntu Mate](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) and the guys struggle to remember what happened to the [thinkpad classic](http://blog.lenovo.com/en/blog/retro-thinkpad-time-machine/).

12:32 The conversation moves onto [Crunchbang](http://www.crunchbanglinux.org/), [Bunsen Labs](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/) and [Crunchbang PlusPlus](https://www.crunchbangplusplus.org/)

14:16 The conversation moves onto [Libre Office 6](https://www.libreoffice.org/donate/dl/deb-x86_64/6.0.2/en-US/LibreOffice_6.0.2_Linux_x86-64_deb.tar.gz) and the [new features](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/new-features/) this brings.

16:21 Wayne asks about [Collabora's](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/) relationship with Libre Office and the Document Foundation. Mike tells us and goes on to explain that the Libre Office community does not want to reinvent the wheel by recreating all the good work being done by others in the free and open source world in terms of email clients and hosting. [Do one thing and do it well!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) ;)

18:21 Mark asks Mike about how [Libre Office schedules its releases](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/release-notes/) and how distributions package them.

21:43 Wayne asks Mike about the size of the [user base of Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/who-uses-libreoffice/) and Mike estimates it at 100 million. He goes on to promote Libre Office as a great software suite to be involved in, as your changes will have beneficial effects for many millions of people. Mike finishes the segment talking about the benefits of open standards compared to proprietary formats when considering the possibilities of data leakage.

27:09 Wayne goes off topic and asks Mike about [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). While none of the guys use it, they discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of Microsoft creating it.

31:23 The conversation moves onto the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). Discussions range around the [Raspberry Pi3 B Plus](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/), memory limitations and what people's Pis are being used for. When the conversation turns to Pi-Hole and ads, Mark mentions [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/) as a hosting service for open source documentation that serves [Ethical Ads](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html). Wayne also mentions that he uses [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) to block facebook and social media tracking. Facebook has Mike's profile so wrong they're trying to sell him Malayasian Cars

39:27 Under the Hood: Mike tells us about the [Pine-Book 64](https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=3707), a new $99 laptop that he saw at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2018/), running (he thought) [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/).

Wayne tells us about a problem he had in [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). When Firefox wouldn't start, Wayne had to fix his Firefox profile, using this command: ` Firefox -P`. He found this from [this website](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles#w_starting-the-profile-manage).

Mark tells us about an article he came across on the EFF regarding [Facebook API Profile sharing](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/how-change-your-facebook-settings-opt-out-platform-api-sharing). Mike goes on to tell us about [TOSBack](https://tosback.org/), the terms-of-service tracker.

47:45 A German Saying of the Podcast is kindly given to us by Mike: "Wir vom Podcast w&uuml;nschen euch ein sch&ouml;nes Ostern. Macht weiter mit Linux, Open Source and nat&uuml;rlich LibreOffice", or The Podcasters wish you a happy Easter. Carry on using Linux, Open Source and naturally LibreOffice.
