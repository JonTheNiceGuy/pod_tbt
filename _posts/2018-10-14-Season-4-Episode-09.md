00:25 Wayne welcomes us to Series 4 Episode 9 on this, the 13th October, 2018. It's beautiful, windy and cool in Bristol, and Mark tells us that he survived Storm Callum to tell the tale. Mark tells us that Extreme Weather can Extreme off for itself.

02:10 Wayne asks Mark what he's been up to and Mark tells us. Paper work has a tendency to boggle Mark's mind. Aside from that, Mark tells us to watch Mr.Robot Series 3. He also relates a cautionary tale regarding his use of [simple-scan](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/simple-scan) and not understanding the process that goes into scanning large amounts of documents. Mark tells us to [festina lente](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Festina%20lente), or hasten slowly.

10:43 Mark asks Wayne what he's been up to. Wayne tells us that he's continuing with his journey's through Linux audio; he's been using and donated to the [zyn-fusion](http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/zyn-fusion.html) application, continuing to enjoy using the <a href="https://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Carla">Carla</a> plugin and he's been in contact with [Unfa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAYKj_peyESIMDp5LtHlH2A) about an Ardour beginner's course, and Unfa is waiting for [Ardour 6](https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/releases/tag/6.0-pre0). Wayne is interested to see what Ardour 6 will be like. He goes on to say that he has upgraded to [Nextcloud 14.0.3](https://nextcloud.com/changelog/#latest14) and so far so good, he's happy with it, Nextcloud talk doesn't rev up his fans as much, it's [bigger better faster stronger](https://vimeo.com/16101785) to paraphrase [Daft Punk](https://daftpunk.com/). Wayne is also impressed with the [Nextcloud Security Scan checker](https://scan.nextcloud.com/). Mark and Wayne think that these features are important in staying secure.The guys agree that it's important to reach for an A+.

20:55 This leads the guys to talk about network cables, minimum lengths of network cables, and [spark gap erosion proof connections](http://www.siemon.com/us/ConvergeIT/poe/effects-of-spark-gap-erosion-caused-by-unmating-under-poe-load.asp) ([IEC-60512-99-001 standard](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/2415)).

27:42 This leads the conversation onto the benefits of [WiFi6](https://www.howtogeek.com/368332/wi-fi-6-what%e2%80%99s-different-and-why-it-matters/).

32:10 Wayne brings the conversation around to the [Head First Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/head-first-books). Mark got the bundle and discusses his first impressions. Both Wayne and Mark think this head first style of learning may be a good thing. If you're interested there's only two days left, so get it now! Wayne and Mark go onto discuss the [Make Electronics 2018 bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/make-electronics-2018). Both of them are unsure if they will get this bundle though. Mark mentions there is a [FabLab in Limerick](http://fablab.saul.ie/).

40:22 Wayne tells us about the [new sweatshirts](https://www.hellotux.com/the_binary_times) available from [Hello Tux](https://www.hellotux.com/). Mark tells us he's going to be wearing his Binary Times gear when they go to Freenode in a few weeks.

42:50 Wayne mentions a [beginners guide to JACK](http://libremusicproduction.com/articles/demystifying-jack-%E2%80%93-beginners-guide-getting-started-jack) that he found at the [Libre Music Production](http://libremusicproduction.com/) website that's worth a look for anyone interested in learning more about JACK.

43:50 Under the Hood. Mark's Under the Hood is `sudo apt remove [package-name]` and `sudo apt purge [package-name]` to remove an application while leaving configuration files intact and to remove an application and all its associated files, respectively.

Wayne's under the hood is about the [memory split on the raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=437683).

To access the memory split functionality, from the console type `raspi-config` -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Memory Split

47:53 Irish saying of the podcast: "Cad at&aacute; t&uacute; a d&eacute;anamh idir na fiacla" or What are you making between the teeth!

We hope you enjoy the podcast as much as we did making it!
