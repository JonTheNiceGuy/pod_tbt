00:24 Wayne welcomes us to a somewhat darker Series 2 Episode 10. Darker in that the guys have moved their recording time forward to Friday night! Wayne checks his body temperature to turn on the heat, Mark loves the rain, and Wayne misses it. Bristol's so cool the sun shines even at night!

01:18 Wayne asks Mark what he's been up to and Mark tells us his main desktop is [back on Unity](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04.3/), he's been having some [Windows fun](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/windows-10-activation) and he's replaced [ Ubuntu 17.10](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/1710) with [Chakra Linux](https://chakralinux.org/) on his laptop. More on all this later.

01:50 Mark asks Wayne what he's been up to and Wayne's been doing so many things he's afraid he'll forget them all! He starts with telling us that he's updated all his android devices to [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org/) with [fdroid](https://f-droid.org/) only, which is a Free and Open Source application store for Android. No [google apps](https://play.google.com/store) have been installed in his new setup. When specific applications that Wayne needs aren't in f-droid he goes to the application's web site and downloads the .apk, [wire](https://wire-app.wire.com/android/prod/wire-3.2.373.apk) being an example of this.

Mark admires many of the cool things Google does while lamenting the fact that these really cool things are being brought to us by a global for profit advertising corporation and not for the benefit of us all.

06:49 Wayne recants some fake news, correcting himself by saying that not all of his Galaxy products are on lineage as his Galaxy S 3 is still running [CyanogenMod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod). Wayne asks our audience for any help or advice that they might have on getting his Galaxy S3 to work on [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org/). He goes on to tell us that he was considering buying a [ Nexus 5X](https://www.google.com/nexus/5x/), but didn't, while Mark tells us his [Nexus 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_4) is sitting on a shelf near him, on its second battery, no less, while the [Xperia's](https://support.sonymobile.com/ie/xperiaz/) battery is too hard to replace.

09:32 Wayne continues to tell us what else he's been up by informing us of his [router](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/RTN66U/) [firmware upgrades](https://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Asus_RT-N66U).

12.25 Mark tells us of his experience in downloading, installing and using [Chakra Linux](https://chakralinux.org/) . Initially he praises the documentation and ease of install. He notes that after install the distribution upgrade was 417MB, but with that he now has KDE Plasma version 5.11.2, KDE Frameworks 5.39.0 while the kernel stayed the same at 4.12.4-1-CHAKRA. He goes on to tell us of the nice Chakra section and then tells us what applications come with the distribution while questioning some of the default packages. He admits that he's used Chakra in the past and likes it but is always drawn back to Ubuntu for the variety of software. This leads into a conversation about various elements of software in different distributions. Mark is looking forward to talking to people in the Chakra community to find out why they chose the applications they chose, and he follows up with a quick explanation, in his own words, of what the Chakra distribution is, its history and what it is trying to achieve. Feedback welcome on this!

23:32 Wayne jumps in with more news on what he's been doing to tell us that he's replaced [teamviewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) with [X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php) server. He's really impressed with it. Mark talks a bit about his own experiences with teamviewer which leads into a bit of a discussion about remote support.

31:27 Mark tells us some more about his adventures with proprietary software. Nuff said!

32:54 Mark tells us that [the binary times podcast](https://thebinarytimes.net/) is now on [Distrowatch](http://distrowatch.com/)!

33:40 Mark talks about the [fingbox](https://www.fing.io/),  a newly available network security and troubleshooting tool. Despite Mark saying that the fingbox is only available to US and Canadian Amazon users, [the fingbox is also on amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fingbox-Network-Security-Toolkit-Troubleshooting/dp/B072JTVTJS/). So excited are the guys with their "news for us" that Mark forgets what a "scoop" is called and Wayne are Mark are lost!

36:25 It must be time for Under the Hood! Wayne's Under the Hood is this:

To mute tabs in Firefox, right click on a tab and select 'mute tab'. This is useful to mute email notifications and any other audio coming out of any of your open tabs.

His second tip is to do with writing emails in Thunderbird. To change the default behaviour of going to a new paragraph when pressing enter to creating a new line, do this:
1. Click Edit Menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Composition -&gt; General Tab -&gt;
1. Uncheck Use paragraph format instead of body text format by default
1. This tip works for Thunderbird 52

Mark doesn't use Thunderbird anymore as he uses [Kolab Now](https://kolabnow.com/) and its web client for his email services

This brings the conversation around to the values of hosting your own applications versus using offsite providers. This gives Mark an opportunity to plug their [Patreon Page](https://www.patreon.com/thebinarytimes).

44:20 Mark tells us about three commands that are essential to Free and Open Source Software:
* `./configure` This command is used to check if you have everything needed to build the application from source code.
* `make` This command compiles the source code and links whatever external libraries are required.
* `sudo make install` This command installs the compiled sources into the appropriate parts of your system directories.

46:07 Wayne prompts Mark for the Irish Saying of the Podcast that he's been saving for now, Mark replies with "d&uacute;n do bh&eacute;al", or shut your mouth! As good a way as any to finish the podcast!
