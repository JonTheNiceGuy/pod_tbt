00:24 Wayne introduces the show once again with a weather update for Bristol while Mark tells us it's a bit muggy in Kilkishen

01:13 Mark tells us he's been working his way through [Python Crash Course](https://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/) by [Eric Matthes](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc) and is chomping at the bit to get to the projects. Wayne finds programming is something that you have to do on a regular basis or forget about it, Mark thinks that's much like everything, and that's why the show notes are a good reminder to us all!

03:38 Mark continues to tell us he installed [Linux Mint 18.2](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=237) on his Dad's PC. He didn't install [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntumate.org/) on the PC due to his Dad already using and preferring Linux Mint on a [Dell laptop](http://downloads.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_laptop/esuprt_inspiron_laptop/inspiron-15-3559-laptop_reference%20guide_en-us.pdf) that he has. He goes on to offer a tip on synchronising gmail contacts with [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) and that is an add-on called [gcontactsync](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/gcontactsync/) and also that the default address book is called abook.mab and it can be found in the hidden Thunderbird profile folder.

08:30 This brings up a conversation on [Outlook](https://products.office.com/en-US/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook) and [Office 365](https://www.office.com/), how [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) might be used as the email client instead of [Outlook](https://www.office.com/) and the pros and cons of such a move. Mark suggests [Evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution/) might be a better fit due to its groupware capabilities. Mark goes on to suggest [Kolab Now](https://kolabnow.com/) as a replacement for [Office 365](https://www.office.com/). The guys try to drum up some support for their [patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/thebinarytimes) for when Wayne relies entirely on his podcasting career for his income.

16:00 Wayne changes topic to talk about his latest Raspberry Pi adventures, in which he and his son built the [laser trip wire](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/laser-tripwire/) project to prank Wayne's partner!

18:25 Mark tells us that stack skills have a [Raspberry Pi Mastery bundle](https://stackskills.com/p/the-raspberry-pi-mastery-bundle) course available now for $31, though there are plenty of other free [resources](https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/) available on the net.

19:02 Wayne tells us about [Ben Nuttal's gpiozero library](http://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html). He goes on to tell us about a [keynote that Ben Nuttal made at pycon russia](	http://bennuttall.com/pycon-russia-keynote-physical-computing-with-python-and-raspberry-pi/) last year that is well worth a watch.

22:19 The guys discuss the end of [systemau](http://systemau.net.au/), "An Australian Technology podcast with a linux bent."

25:18 Mark moves on to the "So you've installed Ubuntu MATE, now what" section with a discussion of what other applications you should install. Applications mentioned are [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) ([Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is the preferred browser of both the guys), [Gimp ](https://www.gimp.org/), [Inkscape ](https://inkscape.org/en/) and [MyPaint](http://mypaint.org/). Mark tells us how much he likes the [Ubuntu MATE Software Boutique](https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/software-boutique/) and goes on to say that the accessories section is well worth a look. Mark tried the Mutiny panel from the [MATE Tweak Tool](https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/mate-tweak) but he experienced a crash so reverted to the MATE panel. He expects to try it again in [17.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-mate-settings/17.10.7). The guys ponder the best way forward for Mark's main desktop, fresh install or further tweaking.

38:02 Mark kicks off Under the Hood with a discussion on [htop](http://hisham.hm/htop/) and [top](https://www.tecmint.com/12-top-command-examples-in-linux/). Wayne installs htop on everything, as well as [vim-gui-common](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/vim-gui-common). Mark also mentions [nmon](http://nmon.sourceforge.net/pmwiki.php), a nice cli tool which gives a graphical representation of various system elements

40:29 Wayne has an Under the Hood too, more [vim](http://www.vim.org/) tips.
* Vim provides the :s (substitute) command for search and replace;
* The :substitute command searches for a text pattern, and replaces it with a text string. There are many options, but these are what you probably want:
  * `:s/foo/bar/g` Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.
  * `:%s/foo/bar/g` Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.
  * `:%s/foo/bar/gc` Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.

44:30 Irish saying of the podcast: [C&eacute;n t-Am &Eacute;?](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/41815004/) or what time is it?
