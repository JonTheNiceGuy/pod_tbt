00:24 Wayne welcomes us all to Series 4, Episode 12, our 50th Episode! Wayne explains how 12 times 4 equals 50. For this episode we have a number of guests, being [Ben Klaasen](https://twitter.com/benklaasen), [Maurizio Porrato](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maurizioporrato) and [Mike Saunders](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/author/mikesaunders/). Wayne thanks them for their previous contributions and then asks each in turn what they've been up to in the Linux world.

03:52 Mike kicks things off by telling us that he's looking for ways to use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/). Mike asks for any suggestions as to geeky projects that could occupy him for Christmas. Wayne suggests the [Rod of Doom](https://nc.fortlands.net:444/index.php/s/RiagCM5mXWE9Con). Mike recalls [Ben Everard's cat targetting Nerf gun](https://www.linuxvoice.com/issues/006/nerf6.pdf), while Ben Klassen's suggestion of editing [sendmail configuration files](https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.1/Deployment_Guide/s3-email-mta-sendmail-changes.html) isn't exactly what Mike was looking for... Mark tells us he'll be modifying Wayne's [Rod of Doom](https://nc.fortlands.net:444/index.php/s/RiagCM5mXWE9Con) to make the game [Operation](https://shop.hasbro.com/en-us/product/classic-operation-game:03B9FF5E-5056-9047-F5FF-D57592C4E2FE) sound more realistic. Wayne is happy once we're [giving back to the Linux Community](https://linuxwebdevelopment.com/6-ways-to-give-back-to-the-open-source-community/) and Ben is impressed that the brightest minds of our generation are using their talents to solve the [pressing problems of the day](https://www.edutopia.org/project-based-learning-student-motivation).

08:47 Maurizio tells us he's been busy in work deploying open source applications on proprietary Operating Systems, namely [The Foreman](https://www.theforeman.org/) on [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows). He's concluded from this that deploying open source solutions on proprietary operating systems is problematic. He goes on to tell us that in his spare time he is looking into [self hosting](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted) the services that he is currently using, drawing inspiration from sites like [privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/) and [prism-break.org](https://prism-break.org/en/). He's also looking into ways to make his self hosted services more resilient. Ben and Maurizio discuss the challenges in hosting email and how the federated future where we self host everything will be difficult to manage. Wayne tells us that he self hosts as much as he can, apart from email.

15:10 Ben tells us that he's changed his desktop environment from [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) to [KDENeon](https://neon.kde.org/). Ben's been using [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) since [Dapper Drake](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperDrake), and [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) since [Unity](https://unity-desktop.org/), but decided to try [KDENeon](https://neon.kde.org/) to see what all the fuss was about. He really likes all the little touches that make [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) great. He goes on to tell us that he has been changing friends of his over to Linux, and has found the whole process quite interesting. This leads to a discussion about how people use software and hardware and how people should be educated in their use. The guys aren't sure if the [ECDL](http://ecdl.org/about-ecdl) is still a thing.

22:41 Mark tells us of his [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) binge and his woes with the [Pi-Hut](https://thepihut.com/). He goes on to tell us about his new [Picade](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picade) and how cool it is, he's really impressed with the build quality. Mark reminds us of the importance of reading Errata. Wayne reminds us of the importance of using properly rated power supplies.

27:43 Wayne tells us that he purchased two [Western Digital Reds](https://www.wd.com/products/internal-storage/wd-red.html) for his NAS. He compares the energy consumption of older hardware compared to newer hardware. We then talk about the differences in the different coloured Western Digital drives. The conversation moves on to the [Odroid NAS](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-hc2-home-cloud-two/) which looks to be much more performant than the Raspberry Pi.

34:50 Ben kicks off Under the Hood and tells us about [ABCDE](https://abcde.einval.com/wiki/) and [DDRescue](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/). He recommends [ABCDE's man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/abcde) as very good. He also tells us that it is important to use [GNU DDRescue](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/) rather than [DD_Rescue](http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/ddrescue/) as [DD_Rescue's author](http://www.garloff.de/kurt) recommends [GNU DDRescue](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/) as an easier alternative.

39:46 Maurizio tells us about the benfits of using [strace](https://strace.io/). This leads to a discussion around the pros and cons of using [strace](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html) and / or [dtrace](http://dtrace.org/blogs/).

43:56 Wayne tells us to use `hostname -I`. To get your public IP address is `curl ifconfig.me`

45:41 Mike's one is based on [imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) and in particular [Fred's Imagemagick page](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/) which contains a load of scripts for modifying images using imagemagick. Mike's inspired to do more with imagemagick because of this page.

48:12 Mark's Under the Hood is very seasonal and is hints on tips on ethical shopping from [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/) and [FSF's Ethical Buyer's Guide](https://www.fsf.org/givingguide/v7/)
