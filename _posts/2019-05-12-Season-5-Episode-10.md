00:24 Wayne welcomes us to Series 5 Episode 10, and the guys discuss the weather and the impending heatwave.

02:50 Mark tells us he was on [Linux Lads](https://linuxlads.com/) discussing
[Linuxy stuff](https://linuxlads.com/episodes/season-2-episode-9). This leads the conversation around to [Foss Talk Live](https://fosstalk.com)
and then on to the [OTA 9 release of Ubuntu Touch](https://ubports.com/blog/ubports-blog-1/post/ubuntu-touch-ota-9-release-225).

08:55 Mark goes on to talk about a recent [Occupational Safety and Health conference](https://www.healthandsafetyreview.ie/conference-details/8)
he was at, highlights of which were the [population pyramid](https://www.populationpyramid.net/ireland/2017/) and the way its shape is becoming
one of a pig swallowed by a snake, and how this in turn leads to 
[six megatrends shaping the future workforce environment](https://www.csiro.au/en/news/news-releases/2018/six-megatrends-workplace-health-safety),
the first point of which, extending the reach of automated systems and robotics led into the third presentation on
[Industry 4.0](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2015/engineered_products_project_business_industry_4_future_productivity_growth_manufacturing_industries.aspx)
and [cobotics](https://www.coboticsworld.com/). The word Cobot is a contraction of two words, these being collaboration and robot.
[ISO/TS 15066:2016](https://www.iso.org/standard/62996.html) specify the safety requirements for collaborative industrial robot systems and the
work environment. Other standards related to cobotics / robotics include [EN ISO 12100](https://www.iso.org/standard/51528.html),
[EN ISO 13849-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/69883.html), [EN 1037](https://cemarking.net/tag/en-1037/),
[EN ISO 13850](https://www.iso.org/standard/59970.html), [EN ISO 13855](https://www.iso.org/standard/42845.html),
[EN ISO 13857](https://www.iso.org/standard/39255.html), [EN ISO 10218-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/51330.html),
[EN ISO 10218-2](https://www.iso.org/standard/41571.html), [EN ISO 11161](https://www.iso.org/standard/35996.html).
Legislation in Europe concerning robots is the
[Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC](https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/directive-2006-42-ec-of-the-european-parliament-and-of-the-council)
and use of robots is contained within the [Work Equipment Directive 2009/104/EC](https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/3). The take away
from the presentation was that these technologies are going to be happening whether we want them or not and this led Mark to think about the
conversation [Doc Searles and Simon Phipps had at Freenode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOFuQLTVdZc). Instead of a head long rush into a technological
dystopia controlled by profiteering corporations, we need to build socially acceptable norms where humanity is respected followed by regulation and
legislation. The guys have a discussion around the whole topic. Wayne tells us [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/) are still using
[Windows XP](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14223/windows-xp-end-of-support)...

30:20 Wayne tells us about the work he's been doing with the podcast. [Feedburner](https://feedburner.google.com/) is going and will not be available
come Season 6. Please resubscribe to our [RSS feed](https://www.thebinarytimes.net/rss-ogg.xml). Mark tells us a bit about the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). Wayne goes on to tell us some more about [Snipe IT](https://snipeitapp.com/) and some scripting he's been
doing. He's also spun up an [OSTicket](https://osticket.com/) virtual machine and a
[Unify Controller](https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/220066768-UniFi-How-to-Install-and-Update-via-APT-on-Debian-or-Ubuntu) virtual machine. He
tells us about his back up solutions for same and his use of [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to help accomplish this. He's also been playing around with
Electronics using some of his Humble Bundle books in preparation for [Linux Presentation Day](http://linux-presentation-day.org.uk/). Wayne goes on to
mention some of the current bundles, including [Python by O'Reilly](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/python-oreilly-books),
[Write like a writer](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/write-like-a-writer-books) and
[Financial Technology by Wiley](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/financial-technology-books). Mark brings up
[Freenode Live](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsYAJYM22VA2NMo61bxIXowgXXHufwPm8) once more and promises to link to it in the shownotes!

51:18 Under the Hood! Mark's under the hood is `curl wttr.in/[insert location]`

In Wayne's under the hood, he tell us about Markdown, and what makes it so great. Wayne's using a markdown addin for Thunderbird called 
[Markdown here](https://markdown-here.com/). He also recommends [CodiMD](https://demo.codimd.org/), which he heard about on the
[Ask Noah Show](https://podcast.asknoahshow.com/126).

56:54 Irish Saying of the Podcast - "Fado Fado" or Long, long ago. Mark thinks long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away could be said as "fado fado, 
i r&eacute;altra i bhfad i gc&eacute;in"

Thanks for listening, we hope you enjoy the show as much as we did making it!
