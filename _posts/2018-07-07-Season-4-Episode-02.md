00:24 Wayne introduces Series 4 Episode 2 from a hot and sweaty Bristol. Mark's enjoying the pleasant change. Wayne goes on to introduce Maurizio Porrato, a listener of the podcast who's quite the expert with [LVM](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/whatislvm.html). A conversation ensues around Maurizio's Linux experience, how best to use LVM and some chat about various distributions. Maurizio recommends the [CentOS documentation on LVM](https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/Cluster_Logical_Volume_Manager/) as well as the [man pages](https://linux.die.net/man/8/lvm) for more information on using LVM.

19:00 Wayne asks Mark what he's been up to and Mark goes on to say that he's been working to try to get a web site together for the upcoming Kilkishen's Coder Club using [W3.CSS templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp). Both Mark and Wayne talk about the usefulness of the [w3schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/) and Wayne goes on to read out what is [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp). Wayne provides a link to [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) and [You Tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJHBKwbf4Us) for further information.

25:54 The guys announce the winner of the competition, Ben Klaasen. We hope you enjoy your [Binary Times T-Shirt from Hello Tux](https://www.hellotux.com/the_binary_times), wear it with pride!

27:42 Wayne tells us about his adventures with [cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/), a server manager that makes it easy to administer your GNU/Linx servers via a web browser.

31:07 Wayne talks about the recent experience he's had with [sweethome3d](http://www.sweethome3d.com/) and both Wayne and Mark praise the software for its ease of use. Mark, never being known to have big ambitious daydreams, goes on to tell us that he wants to model his house and in fact his entire village in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

35:22 Mark tells us that [the vote on the Copyright Directive in the EU Parliament did not pass](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180628IPR06809/parliament-to-review-copyright-rules-in-september) and will have to go back for further review in the parliament in September.

36:50 Under the Hood - Mark has a really fantastic Under the Hood - `snap install xonotic`, [xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org/) being a fantastic, fast paced shooter that is also free and open source and has also recently been snapped by those wonderful snappy people.

39:09 Wayne's under the hood is with regards to [vifm](https://vifm.info/), a file manager with curses interface which provides a Vi like environment. Wayne likens it to [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/) but with Vi key bindings. Some useful commands available in vifm are as follows:

* `P` - Paste / Put the files into the selected pane without going through the trash
* `C` - clone a file (makes a copy of it and adds a number after it)

Mark puts on his best worbly Oirish accent so no one will understand to deliver the Irish Podcast of the saying: "B&iacute; cinnte agus do l&oacute;n ar fad a ithe inniu" or Be sure to eat all your lunch today! Congratulations once more to Ben winning the t-shirt, thanks to Maurizio for joining us today and thanks for listening, we hope you enjoy the show as much as we did making it!
