00:24 Wayne welcomes us to the penultimate, action packed Episode 11 of Season 2. It's cold and dry, a nice combination!

01:45 Mark tells us he's been busy with work and in between all that he's been getting used to [Chakra OS](https://chakralinux.org/) and reading the [getting started documentation](https://community.chakralinux.org/t/welcome/8). The guys are also loving the new [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/). Mark describes the [tutorial](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/get-started-firefox-overview-main-features) and mentions the [screenshot feature](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-screenshots) as a useful new tool and this leads to a conversation around [shutter](https://launchpad.net/shutter) and [mate-screenshot](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-mate-screenshot/) (source [here](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-utils/tree/master/mate-screenshot)). Addons and plugin deprecations get a mention and Mark tells us that his citrix receiver plugin is working on his current setup with [Firefox 57](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/57.0/releasenotes/), [Unity 7](https://launchpad.net/unity) and [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/).

08:28 Wayne tells us that he's replaced his Samsung Galaxy S3 with a [Nexus 5X](https://www.google.com/nexus/5x/) running [CopperheadOS](https://copperhead.co/android/). Wayne was tipped off to Copperhead OS by [Bryan Lunduke](https://vid.me/BryanLunduke). Mark tells us he's still running the [ubports Ubuntu Touch on his BQ](https://ubports.com/page/get-ubuntu-touch) and considers running [Lineage 14.1 on his Nexus 4](https://download.lineageos.org/mako).

15:15 Wayne revives the beginner's corner Ubunt MATE section of the podcast with some hints on how to change preferred applications. The application he changes by default is of course the text editor to [vim](http://www.vim.org/). This is how it's done:

1. Go to System Menu -&gt; Control Center
1. In the Personal section select Preferred Applications
1. There you can change your default applications
1. Jump between the tabs there Internet / Multimedia / System / Office / Accessibility and change your default applications at will
1. This is what it is like in MATE 16.04

Mark adds some KDE tips on how to achieve the same thing but differently.

22:22 Mark tells us all about [the Warlock of Firetop Mountain](http://store.steampowered.com/app/324740/The_Warlock_of_Firetop_Mountain/), a fantasy role playing game now available on Steam for Linux. He goes on to tell us in other things he's been doing that [NASA have a new science podcast](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-expands-podcast-selections-with-new-science-series) and shares the news that a Unity 7 community is trying to become an [official flavour of Ubuntu](https://community.ubuntu.com/t/unity-maintenance-roadmap/2223). Wayne tells us that operating systems and networking and the like provide him with all the puzzle solving satisfaction he needs so he doesn't really play games anymore, despite being a fan of [Elite](https://web.archive.org/web/20100127094607/http://frontier.co.uk/games/elite) and having played other games back in the day.

30:12 Wayne moves the conversation onto Android keyboards. He gives us these hints to expand the Android keyboard to a "full size" keyboard:
1. Go to the Settings app &gt; Language &gt; Input &gt; Google Keyboard
1. Appearance &amp; layouts &gt; Custom input styles. Then touch the plus icon. Choose English (US) as the language and PC as the layout. Then touch Add.
1. Now launch the keyboard from an app. Hold down on the space bar to switch to your new creation, which will be labeled English (US) (PC).

Wayne got this tip from an [article on greenbot](https://www.greenbot.com/article/2904413/how-to-add-a-number-row-to-the-google-keyboard.html ).

33:47 Mark tells us about the FSF's "Defective by Design" [ethical technology giving guide](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/give_gift_freedom_ethical_technology_giving_guide).

35:15 Under the Hood - Wayne talks about rsync and what an amazing application it is. He quotes [an article from Linux Voice](https://www.linuxvoice.com/make-duplicate-copies-of-data-with-rsync/), that much lamented magazine. Thanks guys for making the content free!

Mark's simple under the hood relates to Chakra OS and how to keep the system updated, and it is: `sudo pacman -Syu`.

42:08 Irish saying of the podcast is "T&aacute; s&eacute; fuar", or it is cold!
