00:24 Intro, only some weather and nail gazing. Mark is calling from the tech hub of Coolick, Killarney. Pick up the number of blips due to wireless tech and you could win a [NICE biscuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_biscuit).

01:52 Mark's been trying to get everything working (successfully) in his mobile studio and has also come to the conclusion that he needs to spend some time tweaking his [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/) set up.

02:52 Wayne's installed [Ubuntu Mate](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) on his CEO's Toshiba Satellite and a HP Mini 210. Wayne'll report back on this linux noob's experiences.

12:45 Wayne extolls the virtues of [Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.com/) as compared to other trading sites.

14:45 Wayne's extolling the virtues of Gumtree because he was able to pick up a roll of [Kortex CAT5e](https://www.kinetic-group.co.uk/kortex_cables/products/data_cable/) for Â£15! He's hoping to do some outdoor Raspberry Pi CCTV IP stuff with it.

19:12 Wayne's made a template in [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) for the podcast recordings!

20:09 Wayne talks about his servers' setups, isolation, port setup and [nginx reverse proxy servers](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/).

24:46 Wayne talks about the [Intel AMT vulnerability](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/01/intel_amt_me_vulnerability/). Mark accepts the fact that security vulnerabilities will always exist because creators create and crackers crack. The [intel software checker](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/26755) is not available for linux yet but apparently is on the way

NOTE: for those concerned an [AMT status checker](https://github.com/mjg59/mei-amt-check) is available for linux, courtesy of [Matthew Garrett](https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/).

31:58 Mark mentions the [Humble Indie Bundle 18](https://www.humblebundle.com/humble-indie-bundle-18) and the [Humble Book Bundle Make:Essentials](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/make-essentials-maker-faire).

35:38 Under the Hood:

Mark talks about the following:
* `apropos [insert keyword to search for]`, a command to search man pages for the provided keyword and to display the results on screen. Example being: `apropos audio | grep pulse`
He mentions the following:

* `find`
* `type`
* `which`
* `locate`
* `slocate`
* `ls`
* `man apropos`
* `pavucontrol`

41:52 Wayne has a midnight commander (mc) tips section:
* Ctrl + Space - on any directory shows the directory size opposite
* Ctrl + \ - Opens up the bookmarks window, good for speedy access to directories
* Alt + , - switch mc's layout from left-right to top-bottom. Useful for operating on files with long names.

Here's the [link](http://klimer.eu/2015/05/01/use-midnight-commander-like-a-pro/) where Wayne is getting (some of) his tips from.

Dog's eager for a walk help wind up this episode, but not before Wayne presents the Irish Saying of the fortnight: ["Nil aon tinte&aacute;n mar do thinte&aacute;n f&eacute;in"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdmVhJEXtps) - There's no fireplace like your own fireplace (ie. there's no place like home).
