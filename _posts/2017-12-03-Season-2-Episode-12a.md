In this special edition we talk to *Noah Chelliah*, previously of the [Linux Action Show](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/tag/linux-action-show/) and now of [Ask Noah Show](http://www.asknoahshow.com/) fame.
Noah tells us a little about himself, how he implements free and open source software in organisations and how to sell this to either the executive board or small business leaders, how [freeipa](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page) can be used to replace active directory while Wayne mentions the [Linux Schools Project](http://www.linuxschools.com/forum/index-main.php).
The conversation moves on to what excites Noah in the Linux World today (it's [Ubuntu 17.10](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/1710)) and then on to modern day security considerations and how convenience trumps security every time. We round out the conversation with a chat about [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) and how fantastic it is now, before finishing off with the obligatory plugs towards Noah's and our shows!
