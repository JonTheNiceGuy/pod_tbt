00:24 The guys are so happy to be welcoming you to Series 3 Episode 4 they can hardly contain their joy! The weather is great too! Woohoo! Wayne has loads of Linuxy stuff to talk about and Mark thinks it's nice to have things to talk about in a podcast. Wayne informs us of some of the limitations of self hosting and Mark informs us all that they are [where they want to be in terms of podcasting](https://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-photography-man-yelling-all-alone-woods-low-angle-side-view-young-standing-image31839647).

03:51 In Mark's news, he tells us that he wrote a game using Javascript and the ["CoderDojo Nano Create with Code Make your Own Game"](https://coderdojo.com/news/2017/09/05/announcing-the-release-of-our-second-book-make-your-own-game/) book. He changed it so that an image of his son has to jump over birthday cakes until he reaches the end and it says "Happy Birthday".

07:56 Mark tells us he's been playing with the [ubports-installer](https://github.com/ubports/ubports-installer/releases/download/0.1.9-beta/ubports-installer_0.1.9-beta_amd64.deb) without much success and has Ubuntu Touch on a [BQ Aquaris 4.5](https://www.bq.com/en/support/aquaris-e4-5-ubuntu-edition/support-sheet) and [BQ M10 FHD](https://www.bq.com/en/aquaris-m10). Mark and Wayne talk about the pros and cons of Ubuntu Touch. At the end of the conversation Mark suggests trying the [installer](https://github.com/ubports/ubports-installer/releases/download/0.1.9-beta/ubports-installer_0.1.9-beta_amd64.deb) first, otherwise use the instructions found on the [devices page over on ubports.com](https://devices.ubports.com/#/).

16:23 Wayne tells us that he has installed [version 13 of Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/changelog/#latest13). Wayne and Mark have a conversation about Nextcloud and all the [new features in Nextcloud 13](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/13/user_manual/whats_new.html). Mark is truly impressed with how good it is and is excited enough to want to set it all up, when time allows...

26:27 Wayne moves the conversation onto hardware issues and a [handy tip for finding memory hogs](https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/tab-with-high-cpu-usage-chrome-firefox/) in [Firefox:](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) open a new tab and type in `about:performance` into the address bar. This will show you your open tabs and any tabs that may be causing issues. Using this tip keeps Wayne calm. Mark mentions that one of his open tabs is regarding [the one million downloads of Libre Office 6.0 in fourteen days](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/02/libreoffice-6-0-1-million-downloads) and thinks we're living in [a golden age of free and open source software](https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/15/the-golden-age-of-open-source-has-arrived/).

30:18 Wayne tells us his last little story with a tale regarding him upgrading all his work machines to [Ubuntu MATE 17.10](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-artful-final-release/). He noticed a little bit of extra strain on his machine. Mark tells us he still uses Ubuntu MATE 17.10 and [Kubuntu 18.04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKxVz_AsgtI) on his laptops, and Wayne mentions the recent upsurge in [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/) podcast chat. Mark says [Plasma 5.12 is great](https://dot.kde.org/2018/01/16/reasons-get-excited-about-kde-2018) but also says unfortunately he wouldn't recommend it to new users due to Discover. He also tells us he is planning on putting Kubuntu 18.04 on his Alienware and thinks that could be interesting due to the Nvidia graphics.

39:21 Wayne thinks they're probably at the Under the Hood Section and Mark agrees. Wayne has two good things to talk about which is great because Mark has nothing to talk about!

Wayne's first under the hood is all about [file access, modify and change times](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2464/timestamp-modification-time-and-created-time-of-a-file), as well as a new birth time. `stat` and `find -cmin -5`.

46:09 Irish saying of the podcast is ["gabh mo leithsceal"](http://1977thecomic.com/comic/gabh-mo-leithsceal/) or excuse me
