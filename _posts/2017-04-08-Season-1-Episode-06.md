00:25 Intro, and yet again the guys would prefer to be outside enjoying the good weather.

01:17 Mark's been busy and struggling to come to terms with [Mark Shuttleworth's announcement that Canonical are canning convergence and concentrating on the cloud and IOT](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/), while Wayne's [upgraded to Nexcloud 11](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/11/admin_manual/maintenance/upgrade.html) to avail of the theming features and [planted some herbs](https://nc.fortlands.net:444/index.php/s/EfIHrvrNnmIYgYV) which are moistened using a Raspberry Pi water irrigation system that he found a tutorial for in [The MagPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/) magazine.

09:24 Mark and Wayne talk about [Canonical's announcement](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/) and the repurcussions ([unity 8 has already been forked](https://yunit.io/)). The conversation digresses to Vim when we discover that Mark bought a new Vim! Mug from Gamestop.

15:20 Wayne uses the opportunity to speak about Tom's tip on Vim colour schemes called [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).

16:33 Mark apologizes to listeners for the lack of show notes and ponders different methods of communications with them, all ideas to [info@thebinarytimes.net](mailto:info@thebinarytimes.net) welcome!

17:41 Mark goes back to speaking about the [bombshell announcement](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/) that he just can't get out of his head. This time he's questioning the use of [Gnome 3](https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/) as the default desktop for Ubuntu 18.04 and not the likes of [KDE](https://www.kde.org/). He also tells us that Martin Wimpress did an interview on the [Ubuntu Podcast](http://ubuntupodcast.org/2017/03/30/s10e04-sulky-meek-work/) explaining [Mate](http://mate-desktop.org/) and [Ubuntu Mate](https://ubuntu-mate.org/).

21:49 Wayne tells us about [Pixel](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-pixel/), the "Pi Improved Xwindows Environment, Lightweight".

25:58 Wayne talks about his inability to give up on Windows because of Music creation. He points us to [Ge Wang's Ted Talk on computer music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-T8kcSRLL0&t=309s) for ways to use failed golf-improving hardware as a creator.

28:56 Under the Hood: Wayne starts the Under the Hood section while Mark scrambles to find something suitable. Alt-space, t to keep the current window on top. Mark can't seem to get it to work in Unity, though he figures it out after the podcast. YMMV! Mark suggests running gui programs from the terminal for troubleshooting purposes.

Wayne and Mark talk about `ls` type commands. [`lsblk`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk), [`lspci -tv`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/lspci), [`lsusb -tv`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsusb), [`lshw`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/lshw), `lshw -c disk`, `lshw -short`, `lshw -sanitized` all get mentioned, while Mark asks what is the [`dmesg`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/dmesg) option to show the time in a more readable format (`dmesg -H`).

Wayne tells us that inserting a space before a command prevents that command from being recorded in your history. This news wows and concerns Mark, so much so that he's interested in finding out more.

42:30 Irish Saying for this Podcast: [Conas at&aacute; t&uacute;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUaubVowPP8) (Howrya?)

43:47 Outro, Marks think this was fairly good episode...
