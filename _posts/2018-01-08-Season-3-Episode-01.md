00:24 Wayne welcomes us to the first episode of Season Three! Yes indeed, Season 3 kicks off on a cold and brisk Sunday morning in Bristol and Kilkishen. The guys tell us about their Christmas revels.

03:46 Mark tells us that he's installed and loving [Kubuntu 18.04](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/) before the conversation moves on to the dreaded [Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities](https://xkcd.com/1938/).

12.01 Wayne tells us of some interesting ways he's been trying to interest his son in Linux. Wayne sneaks in an early Under the Hood with [sl](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl) (Steam Locomotive) while telling us of his son's deviousness on the command line.

19:28 Mark tells us that he's going to try and [minimalize his life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgBpyNsS-jU)...

25:30 Waybe brings it back to Linux talk with some chat about his tablets, flight mode and enabling wireless. This brings some suprise and confusion to Mark, who checks and confirms the premise on his ubuntu touch tablet and yes, you can enable flight mode and wireless at the same time.

32:27 Wayne tells us he's set up [two factor authentication](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/user_manual/user_2fa.html#) on his next cloud box in conjunction with [andOTP](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.shadowice.flocke.andotp/) as his android client.

37:41 Mark mentions [eelo](https://www.eelo.io/) in relation to Wayne's quest to rid himself of google services on android. Mark goes on to regail the efforts of the [ubports team](https://ubports.com/) and [Librem phone](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) for providing free and open source alternatives repecting your privacy in the mobile space.

42:20 The guys give us their New Year's predictions: Wayne can't predict his next hot drink while Mark knows it will be a nice hot cuppa tea.

43:08 Wayne kicks off Under the Hood with this beauty: `tail -f [filename]` provides live monitoring of the last ten lines of the specified file.

44:11 Mark's under the hood is for mounting ISO files. First you need to create the directory where the ISO file structure will reside: `sudo mkdir /media/iso`

Then you mount the ISO in the target directory as a file system (the -o loop part): `sudo mount -o loop path/to/iso/file/YOUR_ISO_FILE.ISO /media/iso`

Irish saying of the podcast: since Mark wants to thank all the listeners for their feedback, he suggests using [gur raibh m&iacute;le maith agat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2zg1vZG9-I) or thanks a million (translated loosely, more correctly "may you have a thousand good things"). Thanks for listening, we hope you enjoyed the show.
