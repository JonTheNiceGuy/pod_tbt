00:24 Intro to our eleventh episode, the penultimate episode of season 1! Weather is as always the first thing we chat about. Very [Irish](https://www.joe.ie/life-style/a-survey-reveals-exactly-how-much-irish-people-talk-about-the-weather-492284)!

01:15 With the weather out of the way, Mark tells us he went to [Insomnia](http://www.insomniagamingfestival.com/insomnia/home) (Note: the link goes to the main festival in the UK rather than the Irish one, the Irish one is 404 at the moment). Mark noticed that the only mic available for sale was the [blue yeti](http://www.bluemic.com/products/yeti/).  Beware of convention pricing! :) Mark also admits to still buying music, [Thurston Moore's Rock and Roll Conciousness](http://thurstonmoore.kungfustore.com/all-products/rock-roll-consciousness-thr09.html), and goes on to tell us he bought [Hearts of Iron IV](http://www.heartsofirongame.com/), a fantastic RTS game covering operational to strategic warfare set in World War II, interesting to the likes of Mark who grew up playing board war games, not so much Wayne, despite Mark's best efforts!

04:40 Linuxy wise, Mark tells us he's only recently installed [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), a free and open source software application for video / audio recording and live streaming. Wayne wonders if it is available as a [snap](https://snapcraft.io/), Mark thinks it is not (Note: it is not available as a snap in the [uappexplorer](https://uappexplorer.com/) site). Mark found it easy to use and had managed to create stuff within half an hour, a win for any creative software. Perfect for all the live streams he'll be doing when he gets his [fibre broadband](https://www.eir.ie/broadband/1000mb-fibre/) in six to eight weeks time!

10:55 Wayne has been playing with his Samsung Galaxy S3s! Solving continual restarts meant hacking two broken 3s together and [installing cyanogenmod 13](https://devs-lab.com/install-cyanogenmod-13-in-galaxy-s3-i9300.html). Wayne discovered the value of good quality data cables through all this, and both of us bemoan the state of phone manufacturers updates.

17:52 Wayne's been studying mysql and python on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Mark's been reading [Python Crash Course](https://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/) and [Essential System Administration, 3rd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596003432.do) over breakfast, many more breakfasts filled with the wonders of sys admin methinks! Wayne makes the point that you need to have a project to make coding interesting.Mark mentions [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) as a good example of doing rather than just reading.

22:21 Wayne responds to one of our listeners regarding how he got [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) to work. [Hard Reboots](https://xkcd.com/1495/) work, but don't solve the underlying problem and it's not really a solution for mission critical data servers.

25:38 Wayne talks about his [nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) setup and syncing between it and his [clients](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/install-nextcloud-client-for-opensuse-arch-linux-fedora-ubuntu-based-android-ios/13657) on his [Ubuntu Mate](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) PC and phone.

30:04 Under the Hood sounds good is our new tagline! Wayne talks about nginx
* `nginx -v `version information
* `nginx -V `enhanced version information with compiler options

Wayne goes on to give us some keystroke VIM tips:
* `o`- enters insert mode in a new empty line below the current one.
* `O`- does the same above the current line.
* `A`- appends at the end of the line you're on.
* `#`- Find the previous instance of the item under the cursor.
* `*`- Find the next instance of the item under the cursor.

Mark wonders where the keys are on the keyboard...

37:51 Wayne does a glancey type review on [ Pro Vim](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484202517) from the recent Humble Book Bundle Linux & Open Source. He needs to look at it again when he has time.

39:12 Mark tries hard to finish a sentence to participate in Under the Hood. He fails to find his Under The Hood tip and this leads the discussion onto [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), free software, [Openelec](http://openelec.tv/) and [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/). Mark laments the harassment Kodi developers have to deal with and the death of the Ubuntu phone.

46:35 Irish saying for the podcast is [N&iacute;l fhios agam](https://forvo.com/word/ga/n%C3%ADl_a_fhios_agam/). What does that mean? N&iacute;l fhios agam!
