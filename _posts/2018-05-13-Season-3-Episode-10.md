00:24 Wayne welcomes us to Season 3 Episode 10 from a slightly cloudy Bristol. The morning has been lovely in Kilkishen. A difference of opinion over the weather almost leads to Mark being fired.

01:22 Mark has been up to all kinds of crazy stuff over the last two weeks. One of those things is installing [KXStudio](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/index.php). Mark mentions that they are looking for [donations](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Donations) and suggests that people donate. Mark decided to put the distribution on a spare hard drive as the [KXStudio applications](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications) use [QT4](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/qt-overview.html) rather than [QT5](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt5-intro.html) on his existing [Kubuntu 18.04](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/18.04/release/) and also just to see what the distribution looks like. Mark decides not to take the bet that Wayne offers that he will stick with it as a distribution. The guys discuss getting serious in the podcast. Note: If Mark had checked the [news section of KXStudio](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/News/) he would have known that [an 18.04 release will soon be ready](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/News/?action=view&url=cadence-090-release-and-kxstudio-1804-preparations).

06:56 Mark discusses the woes of supporting a Windows 10 gaming machine. Let's just say he's not impressed. It bores Wayne too. Mark is waiting for the day when Windows 11 DE is based off of a Linux kernel.

11:15 Wayne moves our Linux podcast on to reveal that he has installed [Gimp 2.10 as a ppa](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/05/gimp-2-10-ubuntu-download). Wayne says it's also available as [a flatpak](https://flathub.org/repo/appstream/org.gimp.GIMP.flatpakref), and Mark discovers it's also available as a [snap](https://snapcraft.io/gimp). Wayne's not a fan of the new dark theme and thinks it may just be that he doesn't like change. He tells us all about the [new features of Gimp 2.10](https://www.gimp.org/release-notes/gimp-2.10.html).

18:09 Wayne updated his work laptop to [Ubuntu MATE 18.04](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-mate/releases/18.04/release/) and it was a breeze. Wayne tells us the [Ubuntu MATE Welcome](https://snapcraft.io/ubuntu-mate-welcome) application, [Software Boutique](https://snapcraft.io/software-boutique) and [Pulsemixer](https://snapcraft.io/pulsemixer) are all snaps now. You install these as follows:
* `snap install ubuntu-mate-welcome --classic`
* `snap install software-boutique --classic`
* `snap install pulsemixer`

Wayne asks Mark to do a df -h on his existing [Ubuntu MATE 16.04](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-mate/releases/16.04/release/) and then the same on a new 18.04 install to see how much bigger 18.04 is compared to 16.04, and also to check the boot up time. Wayne questions whether Ubuntu MATE is a good distribution for older hardware, Mark decides not to share his opinion and Wayne installs [Crunchbang plus plus](https://www.crunchbangplusplus.org/) on older hardware.

24:42 Wayne moves the conversation onto [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/), [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Firefox pulled in another 500MB of software, which the guys marvel over. Wayne suggests [Midori](http://midori-browser.org/) as a lightweight browser, while also promising to do more browsing from the terminal, using the likes of [w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/) and [lynx](http://lynx.browser.org/). Wayne says [the binary times](https://thebinarytimes.net/) is brilliant in a terminal browser. Mark suggests [Falkon](https://www.falkon.org/) web browser as a lightweight browser, which he says he is going to try. The guys discuss software bloat.

31:40 Wayne introduces us to [tube](https://tube.quinzel.tech/), a lightweight youtube browser. Mark tries it out and is impressed by the minimal nature and the speed of the application.

35:37 Mark starts off the Under the Hood section with: `sudo apt -f install` to install dependancies when a dpkg -i [filename].deb fails

37:30 Wayne asks us if we know that you can use [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) as a [cli app](https://github.com/vysheng/tg). Mark says that he knew that but didn't see the utility. Wayne tells us all [the features that are available](https://github.com/vysheng/tg/wiki/Telegram-CLI-Commands). Mark is impressed, Wayne's effort has brought him around to seeing the utility of a cli Telegram.

41:48 Wayne's second under the hood is a nice and simple little one to find out whether you are running a 32bit or 64bit OS, and it is this: `getconf LONG_BIT`

43:00 Before the Irish Saying of the Podcast, Mark tells us that he's redesigned the binary times t-shirt, they both agree that it looks really cool.

44:48 Irish saying of the podcast "Nach bhfuil t&uacute; ag &eacute;isteach" or You're not listening!

On that note, thanks for listening and we hoped you enjoyed it as much as we did making it!
