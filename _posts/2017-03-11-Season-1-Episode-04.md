00:28 intro

00:48 Mark and Wayne talk about Mark's new [LimeSDR](https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr)

11:58 Wayne talks about his latest adventures in [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) and how he has purchased a new [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero-w/)

13:54 Wayne wonders if he has the [proper mindset for python](https://xkcd.com/353/), while [sensehat's api](https://pythonhosted.org/sense-hat/api/) gets an honourable mention.

15:31 Wayne talks about how good the resources are for the [AstroPi](https://astro-pi.org/) and [Sensehat](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/)

17:10 This brings the conversation around to the technologically revolutionary times we're living in, how to cope with it and how little linux we actually discuss

20:45 Baby steps: Mark brings up the fact that he's completed the [ vimtutor](http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html) and notes that vimtutor is installed by default on [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/)  

24:01 Wayne summarises the [astropi stuff](https://astro-pi.org/updates/astro-pi-online-training/), [sensehat](http://www.pythonhosted.org/sense-hat/api/) [resource](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat/worksheet/) sites he's been looking at, and [codeacademy learn python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python), because sharing the knowledge is why we're here.

25:41 Wayne wonders are [prices going up in Memory](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-semiconductors-demand-analysis-idUSKBN15B0UM) and [SSDs](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ssds-skyrocket-cost-upgrade/)

29:05 Under the Hood: - Mark talks about the [`tree`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree) command and how the -X switch and redirecting output to file could prove useful to help create system documentation / tutorials

32:09 Continuing under the hood, Wayne talks about [Byobu](http://byobu.co/), with some tutorial links [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04) and [here](http://www.naturalborncoder.com/linux/2014/10/28/getting-started-with-byobu/)

35:35 Wayne tells an Irish joke!

36:19 Mark brings up [trend 4 in Ericsson's 10 hot consumer trands 2017](https://wcm-test.ericsson.net/networked-society/trends-and-insights/consumerlab/consumer-insights/reports/10-hot-consumer-trends-2017#trend4mergedreality) and this starts a discussion around AR and VR and watching spaces and changing worlds

40:26 The Irish saying for this show is [T&oacute;g go bog &eacute;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAOmx2fRyck) and [ festina lente ](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Festina%20lente)
