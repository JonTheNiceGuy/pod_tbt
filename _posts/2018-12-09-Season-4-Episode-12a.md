Mark welcomes us to a rather different Binary Times Episode. Wayne isn't well, so Mark tells us about what will be coming up in the next episode, which is the Bumper Christmas Episode!

Mark mentions that the [Yogcast Jingle Jam](https://www.humblebundle.com/yogscast/yogscast-jingle-jam-2018) is now available and the [Leadership Now](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/leadership-now-books) bundle is also out and worth checking out!

Stay safe, keep well, get in touch and keep using free software! [Sl&aacute;n go f&oacute;ill](http://talkirish.com/media/p/8101.aspx)!
