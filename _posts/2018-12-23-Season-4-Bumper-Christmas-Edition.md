00:24 Wayne welcomes us to the Super Bumper Christmas Edition of the Binary Times Podcast! Mark comments on the synchronicity between the intro music and the Christmas tree lights that he can see and Wayne tells us of the story behind his [Raspberry Pi Christmas Tree](https://thepihut.com/products/3d-xmas-tree-for-raspberry-pi). The weather is clear in Bristol and grey in Kilkishen. Wayne apologises to our listeners for his absence last fortnight and any possible interruptions through this show.

02:14 Wayne asks Mark what has he been at. Mark tells us that he's been distro hopping like mad! Mark has tried [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/), [Ubuntu 18.10](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.10/), [Elementary](https://elementary.io/), [Nitrux](https://nxos.org/), [Knoppix](http://knoppix.net/), [OpenSuse Leap 15.0](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.0) and finally settled on [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/). Mark also recommends the [Discover LibreOffice](http://www.linux-magazine.com/Resources/Special-Editions/33-Discover-LibreOffice) and [Getting Started with Linux 2nd Edition](http://www.linux-magazine.com/Resources/Special-Editions/32-Getting-Started-with-Linux-2nd-Ed) [Linux Magazine](http://www.linux-magazine.com/) [Special Editions](http://www.linux-magazine.com/Resources/Special-Editions). Mark tells us that since he's back on [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/) he's been able to play [Hearts of Iron 4](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/hearts-of-iron-iv/HIHI04GSK-MASTER.html) to his heart's content, and recommends [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/) for a trouble free desktop experience. This brings about a discussion on the benefits of using the latest and greatest releases. The guys talk about the pros and cons of [Ubuntu MATE 18.04](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-bionic-final-release/) as well. Mark says we can blame *everything* on [Nvidia proprietary drivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWzMvlj2RQ).

Mark tells us that he had his wifi turned off for many years while his kids were young, before they got tablets... Wayne tells us that leaving mobile devices out of the places of rest is a good idea. This leads to a discussion around technology and habits. We have too many bad habits really.

28:35 Wayne tells us that he's started using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) and loving it. Mark agrees they're marvelous. Mark recommends the [Firefox Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/). The guys discuss the limitations of technology and monetary value. 

33:58 Wayne discusses some issues he had with an installation of [Ubuntu Server 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/). Mark tells us he went back to Ubuntu Server 16.04 for the web server he has for the coding club.

36:48 Mark tells us that the [Open Source Community on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/opencommunity) has linked to some information on [NVidia's PhysX engine](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/12/03/physx-high-fidelity-open-source/) going open source under the [BSD-3 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
