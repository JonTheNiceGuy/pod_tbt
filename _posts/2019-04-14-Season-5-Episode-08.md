00:24 Wayne welcomes us to Season 5 Episode 8 of the Binary Times podcast by welcoming our guest to the show, [Michael Tunnell](https://michaeltunnell.com/) of [Tux Digital](https://tuxdigital.com/), [This Week in Linux](https://tuxdigital.com/thisweekinlinux/) and [Destination Linux](https://destinationlinux.org/). The guys talk about the weather and Michael tells us a bit about himself.

05:15 Michael tells us that he's been busy podcasting, doing one a day for the last six days, as well as coding and video work. The guys discuss his busy schedule and what's involved in producing all this content, some of the tools involved being [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) and [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/). He also tells us that he's working on video content for all the new features in all the flavours for the upcoming [19.04 releases](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DiscoDingo/ReleaseNotes). Phew! He's some man for one man!

14:16 Mark tells us that he's trying to get some laptops for the Open Coding Club in Kilkishen and is trying to decide on a distribution. Initially he was thinking of going with [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/), or [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), because of their more familiar desktop environment. He's recently started looking at [Zorin OS](https://zorinos.com/), and the [Zorin OS Lite Education Edition](https://zorinos.com/education/). Mike points out that Zorin is in the process of releasing [Zorin OS 15](https://zoringroup.com/blog/2019/03/20/and-the-next-version-of-zorin-os-is/). Mark goes on to tell us that he plans to upgrade his current [Kubuntu 18.10 to 19.04](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DiscoUpgrades/Kubuntu). Mike informs us his distro of choice is [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/), and of [the work on sane defaults in that distro](https://kubuntu.org/news/kubuntu-18-04-has-been-released/) that he helped make happen. The conversation is rounded out with discussion of [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/), [synapse](https://launchpad.net/synapse-project) and the [brisk menu](https://github.com/solus-project/brisk-menu).

26:02 Wayne tells us that he's been doing some more work with his [motion eye os](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos) setup, including installing [vsftpd](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html#about) and [configuring it all to work with his Raspberry Pi](https://www.instructables.com/id/FerretPi-Using-Raspberry-Pi-as-a-Secure-FTP-Server/). Wayne goes on to tell us about [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), thanks to Ben for the tip! [Snaps](https://snapcraft.io/) get discussed.

36:15 Mark tells us that the [release candidate of 0.10](http://blog.supertuxkart.net/2019/04/supertuxkart-010-release-candidate-1.html) of [Super Tux Kart](https://supertuxkart.net/Main_Page) has been [snapped](https://snapcraft.io/supertuxkart) up since yesterday, the guys hope to play it a bit tonight! 

37:31 Wayne tells us there is a [Linux Presentation Day](http://linux-presentation-day.org.uk) happening in Bristol on 19th May.

40:05 Under the Hood! Michael kicks off Under the Hood with a few great tips for Firefox, starting with [multi-container tabs in Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/), followed by [darkreader](https://darkreader.org/), a dark mode for your web browsing.

Mark tells us about [new autoplay controls in Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/block-autoplay/).

This prompts Mike to tell us about the [Text Area Cache](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/textarea-cache/) add on for Firefox, allowing you to save automatically the content in a text input field.

Wayne tells us about the [podcast pillow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000XS42RQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00), which he wouldn't recommend. He goes on to tell us that searching tabs in firefox doesn't work with containers. Type % followed by the what you want to search for in the address bar to search open tabs. This prompts Mike to provide another Under the Hood for Firefox, and that is [keyword bookmark searching](https://felixcrux.com/blog/favourite-firefox-feature-keyword-search-bookmarks).

54:00 Irish saying of the podcast - "Is fhearr fheuchainn na bhith san duil" It is better to try than to hope! Thanks so much to Michael for a great Irish saying, and we hope you all enjoy this podcast as much as we did making it!
