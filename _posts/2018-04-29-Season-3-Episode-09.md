00:24 Wayne introduces Series 3 Episode 9 from a slightly murky, slightly chilly Bristol while Mark greets us in his [bright orange Ubuntu T-Shirt](https://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?_application_flags=7d5165aae41ea0e2a777ca6b8b20b6cd&currency=EUR&products_id=1088&sort=1a) from a gloriously sunny but chilly Kilkishen

00:57 Wayne asks the question of Mark if there is anything happening in the Linux World. Well, Mark responds by saying that while bits and pieces have been going on his main driver is getting prepared for the [release party in Gleeson's Pub in Kilkishen on the 28th April](http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/ubuntu-ie/3743-ubuntu-1804-release-party/). Mark's expecting everyone to drop everything and come along to have some fun! He also mentions that the [ Dublin Linux User Group](https://www.dublinlinux.org/) is having a [meet up today in the Long Stone Pub in Dublin](https://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Linux-User-Group/events/vzkhnpyxgblc/) and he's sure there'll be some celebration there. Mark mentions the [Dublin Linux User Groups Telegram channel](https://dublinlinux.org/telegram) and a [nostalgic look at Kubuntu 6.06](https://vimeo.com/266930735) made by one of the Dublin Linux User Group members.

03:46 Wayne tells us he picked up the full boxed set of [Star Trek the Next Generation](http://www.startrek.com/database_article/star-trek-the-next-generation-synopsis) on E-Bay. He's been busy ripping the entire thing using [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/). The guys have a discussion on the values of Handbrake which leads onto a discussion about the values of Western Digital Hard Disk Drives.

10:12 Wayne tells us he's [a little bit strange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD4wMlOYPSA)! He wants to install [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)! Mark tells us that from his perspective [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) is the most important Linux distribution out there because of the fact that [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) provides a usable desktop with sane presets that everyday users can pick up and use straight away.

14:34 Mark brings it back to the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS release with a rather [rambly](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/rambling) chat about [Ubuntu's own release material](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2018/04/26/ubuntu-18-04-lts-optimised-for-security-multi-cloud-containers-ai), [Nextcloud's big win-over of the German government](https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-sources-big-german-win-300000-users-shift-to-nextcloud-for-file-sharing/) and the promo videos that have been created by various creators for the release of [Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OTwHSa1KVc), [Kubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzuylNzpZIw) and [Ubuntu MATE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kth-4M62o&feature=youtu.be). Mark goes on to tell us that he installed [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-raspberry-pi-model-b-plus/) and is going to install [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) on his [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/). Wayne tells us that he has installed Ubuntu-MATE 18.04 on a VM and likes it but does have his pet peeves around icon spacing that he may submit a bug for. He also wants to get rid of the word "menu" from the [brisk menu](https://github.com/solus-project/brisk-menu) but doesn't know how while he also tells us that he installs [synapse](https://launchpad.net/synapse-project) as a must, since the brisk menu only searches applications and not files.

30:57 Wayne tells us about a tip he has for automatically centering windows in Ubuntu-MATE and it is this:
* First you need to install the dconf-editor from the terminal: `sudo apt install dconf-editor`
* click on `Applications - System Tools - dconf-editor`
* Click on the magnifying glass up top and type `center-new-windows`
* Switch this option to `ON`

32:20 Wayne came across a really cool project, the [Cayenne project](https://mydevices.com/cayenne/features/). He watched a [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4VbLasx7M) and while he hasn't done much with it yet both Wayne and Mark sound very interested in the idea.

35:18 Mark tells us about a project on Indiegogo, the [Turris MOX](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/turris-mox-modular-open-source-router-security-computers#/), a modular and Open Source router.

38:25 Under the Hood, and Mark tells us about a handy command line tool that helped him to [convert](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) pngs he had made with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) to jpgs, and that is, remarkably, `convert [imagename].png [imagename].jpg`

41:20 Wayne has a little thing that he came across during the week, and that is you can jump between tty sessions by pressing the alt left and alt right.

43:16 Irish saying of the podcast: T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm as a leithsc&eacute;al, or sorry for being sorry!
