### Software Freedom Day - Woohoo!

In their contribution towards the celebration of [Software Freedom Day](https://www.softwarefreedomday.org/), the guys talk about [Free and Open Source Software](http://www.freeopensourcesoftware.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), have their say as to [Why use Free Software?](https://www.softwarefreedomday.org/about/why-foss), chat about the impact free and open source projects like [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) have had and are having and how [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) and [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) are great introductions to free software, inform us of a great tip for using [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/), and finally tell us about the [librem 5](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) crowdfunding campaign and why it is such an important project to back.
