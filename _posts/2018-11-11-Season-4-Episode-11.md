00:24 Wayne welcomes us to Series 4, Episode 11. Bristol's nice and calm, Kilkishen is nice and calm too. Mark comments on the armistice of WWI.

01:33 Wayne announces the fact that Wayne and Mark went to Freenode last weekend, as well as the fact that the Binary Times is at its 49th Episode!

Mark goes on to speak about Freenode and mentions some of the highlight talks for him. The first he mentions is [Doc Searle's](http://searls.com/) and [Simon Phipps'](https://webmink.com/about/) fascinating [discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOFuQLTVdZc&list=PLsYAJYM22VA2NMo61bxIXowgXXHufwPm8&index=6&t=0s) around privacy and free and open source software, followed by [John Sullivan's](https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board) talk on [free communications tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnzs2W8LPB4&list=PLsYAJYM22VA2NMo61bxIXowgXXHufwPm8&index=7&t=0s), [Bradley Kuhn's](http://www.ebb.org/bkuhn/) interactive [chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLJjAupCMUg&list=PLsYAJYM22VA2NMo61bxIXowgXXHufwPm8&index=10&t=0s) and [VM Brasseur's](https://www.vmbrasseur.com/about/) closing keynote on [four ways to spread the four freedoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV9Vt4knqsc&list=PLsYAJYM22VA2NMo61bxIXowgXXHufwPm8&index=21&t=0s). Wayne points out that all the talks are available at [freenode.live](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsYAJYM22VA2NMo61bxIXowgXXHufwPm8). Mark wants people to take back their power and respect their freedom and privacy instead of putting up with their fur lined mousetraps, and governments need to protect the rights of their citizens. Wayne mentions [Leah Rowes](https://vimuser.org/) talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGc4tAR36yo&list=PLsYAJYM22VA2NMo61bxIXowgXXHufwPm8&index=2&t=0s">Libreboot</a> as a good talk.

25:10 Mark tells us in other news that he's replaced his HDD with an SSD and that he's been having some weird issues with the digital clock on his desktop panel.

29:35 Wayne tells us that he's upgraded all his machines to [Ubuntu MATE 18.04](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-bionic-final-release/). He's also upgraded a laptop of his with [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/), though the experience with Discover left him cold (and he's CPU pretty hot if the fans were anything to go by!) and he's back on MATE. Mark tells us he's updated his [Ubuntu Studio](https://ubuntustudio.org) to [18.10](https://ubuntustudio.org/2018/10/ubuntu-studio-18-10-released/).

31:55 Wayne moves the talk onto the [Raspberry Pi TV Hat](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-tv-hat/), a device that both the guys purchased. The guys discuss their experience with it. Wayne used [tutorials on the Pi-Hut](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/how-to-stream-digital-tv-with-the-raspberry-pi-tv-hat) to help him stream TV to different places around the house. He's also streaming to his android devices using [TVHGuide](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.tvheadend.tvhguide/). To help set up kodi he installed [kodipvrhts](https://github.com/kodi-pvr/pvr.hts) by typing `sudo apt install kodi-pvr-hts` on the command line. Wayne's next project is to save the recorded video to his NAS. Mark wants to use his TVHat as a DVR.

40:48 Wayne goes on to tell us that he installed [Raspbian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) on one of his [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) and his network wouldn't work. He found the problem was a typo. It was a tricky one to troubleshoot.

45:26 Under the Hood - Wayne's under the hood is a great one - `df -h |grep /dev/sd`. Mark adds to that by saying you could type `df -h |grep -v loop` to achieve the same thing.Wayne mentions [YADM](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/) as a good dot file manager.

Mark's under the hood was going to be around [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) and [IRC](http://www.irc.org/) and IRC clients, like [Quassel](https://quassel-irc.org/) and [Konversation](https://konversation.kde.org/) and [IRSSI](https://irssi.org/), [hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/) and [smuxi](https://smuxi.im/). The guys are thinking about having a IRC presence for the 50th episode of the Binary Times.

52:05 Irish saying of the podcast: "[Suas S&iacute;os](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O65dCPNOnxc)" or Up and Down.

We hope you enjoyed the podcast as much as we did making it!
