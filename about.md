# Mark

Mark has been working in Telecoms since the 1990s and is currently working for a
large Electricity Utility as a Telecommunication's Professional. He has been
dabbling with Linux since the late 90s and some of his work involves Linux based
telco system admin.

Mark's personal philosophy towards life, work and others is based around ideas of 
social cooperation.

“I am who I am because of who we all are” is an idea espoused by the Ubuntu 
community. It is an idea Mark likes and it is a reason that he is drawn to the 
ideals of free and open source software and free and open source communities and 
culture in general.

Mark is an Associate Member of the Free Software Foundation.

works in the education sector administering systems and introducing linux based

linux based virtualization, web and storage services.

operating systems, he turned to Linux for both server and desktop tasks. He

gardening and ping pong.
